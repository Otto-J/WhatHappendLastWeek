      <description>Show Description
Brad and Ian stop by to chat about their new course, The Complete Guide to Design Tokens, what happens if you don't use design tokens on projects, what the ideal outcome is for building and designing with design tokens, how many colors is enough, what about refactoring, and does Figma or code win the argument?

      <title>Episode 466: Bad performance review and moving in to the caves</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/06/23/episode-466-bad-performance-review-and-moving-in-to-the-caves/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
I had my performance review two months ago where I scored a “Does not meet expectations”, which I definitely understand, and my manager told me that some of my coworkers had been complaining about me. I’ve been working hard on improving ever since and my manager told me that they were really impressed with my progress and told me that some of my coworkers had expressed similar sentiments.
I have now gotten a really good job offer but I’m reluctant to take it. I’m still working on improving myself with the help of my manager and I don’t want to stop working on this. I would also like some more time to show my coworkers that I really have grown before leaving, feels like that would leave behind a more positive image of me. I’m fairly junior still so contacts seem good to have, and better performance does too, and a better job does too. What should I do? :D
Listener Michael Q asks,
‌

    
Hello! I only recently discovered this podcast but it has quickly become a daily ritual in my commute to and from work. Although I am more of a mechanical and data focused engineer, I find the lessons extremely applicable! I work at a midsized biotech company. I have been in my current role for about three years as a product engineer. Because I’m on the commercial side, my contributions have been very visible to the higher ups and have gotten a lot of recognition, which has been great. I am now transitioning to the more hardcore engineering team. Although I admire this team and think they are the most innovative group on site, I think their work goes largely unrecognized as behind the scenes magic. I think they deserve more recognition and accolades for the work they do. How can I bring them into the spotlight? Or am I naive in assuming that just because I am motivated by recognition, everyone else would appreciate it too? Note: I do not want to quit my job.</description>

      <title>The State of Authentication: The Future is BUNDLED!</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/modern-web/episodes/The-State-of-Authentication-The-Future-is-BUNDLED-e34kjdr</link>
      <description>On this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Brian Morrison, Senior Developer Educator at Clerk. They cover the state of authentication today, what makes Clerk stand out for small teams and indie builders, and how thoughtful developer experience design can make or break adoption.Brian shares why bundling tools like auth, billing, and user management is becoming more common, how Clerk handles real-world concerns like bot protection and social login, and why starting with a great developer experience matters more than ever.The conversation also explores the role of AI in software development and content creation, where it helps, where it hurts, and how to use it responsibly without losing quality or trust.Keypoints for this Episode:

Modern auth is about experience, not just security. Clerk simplifies user management, social login, bot protection, and subscription billing with developer-friendly APIs and polished default UIs.

Bundled platforms are making a comeback. Developers are shifting from handpicking tools to using tightly integrated services that reduce setup time and complexity.

Developer education needs more care and creativity. Brian emphasizes the importance of visual storytelling, thoughtful structure, and anticipating confusion to help devs learn faster and retain more.

AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement. The group discusses how AI can accelerate development and content creation when used with oversight, but warn against using it to blindly build entire apps.

      <title>How Holepunch Is Redefining Peer-to-Peer Apps with Bare.js — A New Era for JavaScript Developers -JSJ 681</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/how-holepunch-is-redefining-peer-to-peer-apps-with-bare-js-a-new-era-for-javascript-developers-jsj-681--66732657</link>
      <description>In this episode, we sit down with Mathias Madsen, CEO of Holepunch, and take a wild ride through the cutting edge of peer-to-peer JavaScript development. Mathias shares his journey from accidentally discovering JavaScript in college to becoming a prolific contributor with over 1,500 open source modules. His passion? Building decentralized, peer-to-peer systems where JavaScript isn’t just for the browser—it powers the entire stack.
We dive deep into how Holepunch is reimagining application distribution with their Pear system —essentially turning peer-to-peer into a first-class citizen for distributing full applications, not just files. No hosting, no servers — just apps shared directly, BitTorrent-style. And because packaging and distributing Node-based apps can be painfully complex, they took things a step further by building a new runtime: Bare.js
Bare.js is refreshingly &quot;bare&quot;: it strips away the heavy, opinionated APIs bundled into Node or Deno, leaving just the JavaScript core and a powerful module system. What’s revolutionary here is Bare's ability to run the same codebase across desktop, mobile, and even tiny embedded devices—swapping out engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, or JerryScript depending on the platform's needs. This allows Mathias' team to write backend logic once, share it across all platforms, and iterate at lightning speed.
Key takeaways:
-Peer-to-peer can go far beyond media sharing — it's being used for full app distribution.
-Bare.js decouples JavaScript from specific platforms, creating a universal backend that just works anywhere.
-Modular design isn't just a philosophy — it's the secret to Holepunch’s rapid development pace.
-The combination of React Native for UI and Bare.js for backend creates an insanely productive development pipeline, fully cross-platform.

If you’re into JavaScript, peer-to-peer tech, or just love hearing about developers breaking the mold, this one’s for you.
