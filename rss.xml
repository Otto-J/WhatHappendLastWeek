tldraw
Have you ever wanted to build an app that works kinda like Miro or Figma, that has a zoomable infinite canvas, that’s multiplayer, and really good, but you also want to build it in React with normal React components on the canvas?

Good news! tldraw is the world’s first, best, and only SDK for building infinite canvas apps in React.

tldraw takes care of all the canvas complexities — things like the camera, selection logic, and undo redo — so that you can focus on building the features that matter to your users. It’s easy to use with plenty of examples and starter kits, including a kit where you can use AI to create things on the canvas.

Get started for free at tldraw.dev/shoptalk, or run npm create tldraw to spin up a starter kit.</description>

      <title>Episode 490: How do I break into software dev from QA automation and underselling</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/12/08/episode-490-how-do-i-break-into-software-dev-from-qa-automation-and-underselling/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hi Dave and Jamison, I’ve been in QA/QA automation for 13 years now with a CS degree, and I’ve been trying to change my role to a software developer for a while. My only issue is that every time I brought my career aspirations to my managers they seemed to “not care” or give vague answers to “kick the can down the road”. In the past I fully demonstrated I can do the work by submitting bug fixes, writing and deploying a few microservices by myself (all product feature work), on top of performing my QA duties. I get high marks in my performance reviews, but that doesn’t seem to be enough! I also seem to attract some resentment from my team (silently but it’s noticed) as they see a QA trying to soak up their dev work and I get a strong “stay in your lane” vibe. I do it to help them, not take all of their work. Any advice? Am I approaching this the wrong way? And what would you do in my situation? Thanks and all the best!
Hi!
Three years ago, I relocated from a third-world country to Europe for work. I tend to undersell myself a lot. I know I am a competent, hard-working, and smart engineer. I have strong opinions and can evaluate trade-offs. I can participate in discussions about complex systems, and I have experience managing projects.
But sometimes I’m afraid of looking dumb and scared of confrontation. This means I rarely voice my opinions or suggestions. I often let go of them at the slightest objection, even if I believe the other person is mistaken. Whenever I speak or comment on a subject in Slack, I always use phrases like “I’m not 100% sure”, “as far as I remember”, or “I have to look it up but I think … “. These would not matter If I was showing my confidence through other means like participating in discussions confidently, but these all add up to create an image of someone reliable in getting things done, but not reliable at taking more responsibility.
I was not like this before moving. Occasionally I struggle with the language when in big meetings or talking about complex matters, but I’m comfortable with English. It has an effect for sure, but it is not the cause.
I’m going to start a new position and I want to have a longer career there. But I’m afraid that I can not give myself the head start I know I’m capable of. How can I improve my own personal onboarding process and let my new colleagues and manager know how lucky they are to have me on their team?</description>

      <title>124: TanStack Enters the AI Arena—Meet TanStack AI</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>This week TanStack joins the AI wars with the alpha release of TanStack AI: an open-source AI SDK with a unified interface across multiple providers. TanStack AI is an open-source ecosystem of libraries and standards, and it is client, server, and AI provider agnostic, to make building AI-enabled apps accessible to all.
In a surprise move, AI company Anthropic acquires JavaScript runtime Bun to accelerate its development of Claude Code. Apparently, Bun has been central to Claude Code reaching $1 billion in run-rate revenue in just six months, and Anthropic’s brought the team in house to keep the momentum going.
And it’s been another rough week for security in JavaScript. First, a new self-replicating, credential stealing malware attack, dubbed Shai-Hulud 2.0, swept the npm ecosystem and compromised 800 npm packages in the process, and then a critical security vulnerability was discovered for any React projects using React Server Components. Just remember to lock down your dependencies and install those patches ASAP, folks.
Timestamps:

1:22 - TanStack AI
9:12 - Anthropic buys Bun
21:03 - Shai-Hulul 2.0 on npm and an RSC vulnerability
30:23 - What’s making us happy

News:

Paige - Shai-Hulud 2.0 on npm and RSC vulnerability
Jack - TanStack AI
TJ - Anthropic buys Bun (Bun post) (Anthropic post)

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - The Durrells TV series

      <title>How Varlock Fixes .env Vulnerabilities and Secures Your Secrets</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/modern-web/episodes/How-Varlock-Fixes--env-Vulnerabilities-and-Secures-Your-Secrets-e3c4d87</link>
      <description>Environment variables and secrets are usually a mess: out of sync .env files, scattered API keys, painful onboarding, and brittle CI configs. In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel talks with Varlock co-creators Phil Miller and Theo Ephraim about how Varlock turns .env files into a real schema with types, validation, and documentation, pulls secrets from tools like 1Password and other backends, and centralizes configuration across environments and services. They also dig into protecting secrets in an AI-heavy world by redacting them from logs and responses, preventing accidental leaks from agents, and pushing toward an open env-spec standard so configuration becomes predictable, portable, and actually pleasant to work with.


What you will learn:
- Why traditional .env files and copy paste workflows break down as teams, services, and environments grow.
- How Varlock turns environment variables into a schema with types, validation, documentation, and generated TypeScript.- How to pull secrets from tools like 1Password and other backends without leaving them in plain text or scattering them across dashboards.
- How to manage multiple environments such as development, staging, and production from a single, declarative configuration source.
- How Varlock helps protect secrets in AI and MCP workflows by redacting them from logs and responses and blocking accidental leaks.
- What the env spec standard is and how a common schema format can make configuration more portable across tools, templates, and platforms.

      <title>Eric Seidel - Flutter, Shorebird</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/devtoolsfm/episodes/Eric-Seidel---Flutter--Shorebird-e3c1dj8</link>
      <description>This week we have Eric Seidel, co-creator of Flutter and founder of Shorebird. Eric shares his journey from building WebKit at Apple and Chrome at Google to creating Flutter, a multi-platform UI framework that compiles to native code. We talk about the technical challenges of browser engines, why the web couldn't deliver high-quality mobile apps, and how Shorebird is solving Flutter's code push problem to enable instant app updates without app store approval.

Eric shares his journey from building WebKit at Apple and Chrome at Google to creating Flutter, a multi-platform UI framework that compiles to native code. We talk about the technical challenges of browser engines, why the web couldn't deliver high-quality mobile apps, and how Shorebird is solving Flutter's code push problem to enable instant app updates without app store approval.

      <title>Custom Renderers for Svelte with Paolo Ricciuti </title>
      <link>https://share.transistor.fm/s/09be0140</link>
      <description>In this episode of Svelte Radio, we welcome Jeppe as a new permanent host and sit down with Paolo Ricciuti, Svelte maintainer and Senior Software Developer at Mainmatter, to dive deep into Svelte custom renderers. Paolo walks us through how custom renderers work (using React's approach with React DOM, Ink, and React Native as context), explains the technical challenges of bringing this capability to Svelte 5—including the template element trick, CSP issues, and runtime modifications—and shares his proof-of-concept work enabling Svelte to render to non-DOM targets like terminals and native mobile apps via Lynx.js. The discussion touches on potential use cases like Threlte for 3D graphics, the importance of this feature for Svelte adoption, and wraps up with picks including Screen Studio, TMCP, and Advent of Svelte.

Guest

Paolo Ricciuti — Svelte maintainer and ambassador, Senior Software Developer at Mainmatter


New Host

Jeppe joins as a permanent co-host!


Topics Discussed

Custom Renderers Overview

Svelte Custom Renderers website
What custom renderers are and why they matter
How React separates React (the diffing library) from React DOM (the renderer)
Examples of React custom renderers: 
Ink — React for terminal/CLI applications
React Native — React for iOS/Android native apps
Remotion — React for programmatic video creation
React PDF renderer for generating documents



Svelte's Technical Approach

How Svelte 5 uses the &lt;template&gt; element and innerHTML for fast rendering
The CSP (Content Security Policy) challenges with innerHTML
Paolo's compiler option contribution to enable programmatic element creation
The custom renderer API: defining operations like createElement, setText, setAttribute, appendChild, etc.
Separating the Svelte runtime from DOM-specific code


Lynx.js Integration

Lynx.js — ByteDance's cross-platform framework (powers parts of TikTok)
Why Lynx was the catalyst for custom renderer work
CSS support in Lynx including Flexbox, Grid, and even Tailwind
The difference between Lynx's element approach vs React Native's component imports


Related Projects &amp; Discussions

Threlte — Three.js for Svelte (created by Grisha)
React Three Fiber — Three.js React renderer
Svelte Native — Existing (but limited) Svelte native solution
LiveView Native (Elixir/Phoenix) as a comparison for multi-target templating
Discussion with Grisha about mixing renderers in the same component


Funding &amp; Open Source

Mainmatter's sponsorship of Paolo's custom renderer work
First external sponsor for this initiative
Discussion about using Svelte Open Collective funds for this feature
Why custom renderers matter for Svelte adoption in enterprise


Paolo's Recent Contributions to Svelte

onChange callback for $state (PR in progress)
from action utility
CSP-friendly compiler option (foundational for custom renderers)


Picks

Screen Studio — screen.studio — Mac screen recording app with automatic zoom animations (Kevin's pick, used for Advent of Svelte recordings)
TMCP — github.com/paoloricciuti/tmcp — Paolo's TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework, praised for being much better than the official SDK (Jeppe's pick)
Advent of Svelte — svelte.dev/blog/advent-of-svelte — 24 days of Svelte features and improvements (Brittany's pick)

      <title>The Real State of Tech Hiring: AI, Ghosting, and the Developer Drought - JSJ 698</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/the-real-state-of-tech-hiring-ai-ghosting-and-the-developer-drought-jsj-698--68983323</link>
      <description>In this episode of JavaScript Jabber, Steve Edwards and I kick things off by catching up on life — from winter weather and marathon training to health journeys, CrossFit, and some behind-the-scenes personal stories that shaped how we think about wellness and longevity. After warming up, we shift our focus to the state of the tech job market, something both of us have been watching closely and experiencing firsthand.
We dive into the challenges developers are facing today — especially juniors — and compare our hiring and job-hunting experiences, the impact of AI on resumes and screening, the slowdown in bootcamps, and why the industry feels different than it did even a few years ago. We also unpack economics, incentives, and business realities affecting hiring, plus what developers should be doing right now to stand out.
