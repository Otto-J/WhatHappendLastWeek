      <title>Episode 475: Am I too loyal to my big tech job and politely preserving time</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/08/25/episode-475-am-i-too-loyal-to-my-big-tech-job-and-politely-preserving-time/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hi!
I’m currently working for a big tech company and I’ve just accepted an internal transfer to another team. At the same time, an external company reached out, offering me a job for a role I’m interested in and twice my current compensation.
I’m not sure what to do. The offer from the new company is very interesting and I wouldn’t think twice at accepting it if I still was in my old team. But now that I’ve accepted the internal transfer, I don’t know what’s best for my career: stay with my current company and lose out on a great offer, or go with the new company but likely burn bridges with my current manager, possibly closing off future opportunities to return to my current company (something that I’m open to in the future)?
How do I politely but firmly stop a project manager colleague, who has vast open plains in their calendar compared to my Tetris-stacked week as a senior software engineer, from parking themselves at my desk for 45-minute vent sessions about everything that’s frustrating them about our project? It’s never just the weather; it’s a full-blown TED Talk on their annoyances, which makes me feel defensive and frustrated in return. I’ve tried the headphones-on-and-look-intently-at-the-screen-approach, and sitting on the other side of the office, booking a smaller meeting room to hide, and carrying on working as they tell me about their troubles with both leadership and members of my team. Nothing seems to work. They find me every time. Is there a way to escape without faking my own death or staging an office fire drill? Thanks!</description>

      <title>Alchemy: IaC Without Terraform</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>The latest craze for MCP this week? Instead of multiple MCP servers with different tools, use an MCP server that accepts programming code as tool inputs - a single “ubertool” if you will. AI agents like Claude Code are pretty good at writing code, but letting the agent write and execute code to invoke API functions instead of using a defined MCP server doesn’t seem like the most efficient use of LLM tokens, but it's another approach to consider.
In infrastructure news, there’s a library called Alchemy that lets devs write their Infrastructure as Code in pure TypeScript. No Terraform files, no dependencies, just async functions, stored in plain JSON files, that runs anywhere JS can run. For web devs, the future of IaC has arrived.
Next.js has made their last big release before v16 in the form of 15.5. Highlights of this minor release include: production turbopack builds, stable support for the Node.js runtime in middleware, fully typed routes, and deprecation warnings in preparation for Next.js 16.

      <title>Sentry Has New AI Tools for Monitoring and Developer Workflows</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/modern-web/episodes/Sentry-Has-New-AI-Tools-for-Monitoring-and-Developer-Workflows-e379696</link>
      <description>This episode of the Modern Web Podcast features Cody De Arkland, Head of Developer Experience at Sentry, in conversation with hosts Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson. They explore how Sentry has embraced a culture of experimentation with AI, from grassroots innovation in Slack channels to leadership setting the tone for rapid adoption. Cody shares insights into Sentry’s new AI monitoring tools, including MCP support and agent tracing, which give developers visibility into token usage, tool calls, and debugging flows. The discussion also touches on how AI is reshaping developer workflows, the balance between writing code and prompting, and why structured thinking is key to getting useful results.Keypoints from this episode:- Sentry fosters a playful, experimental environment where both grassroots initiatives and leadership drive AI adoption.- Sentry has rolled out AI monitoring with MCP support and agent tracing to give visibility into token usage, tool calls, and debugging.- AI is changing how developers approach coding, blending prompting with traditional programming.- Success with AI depends on framing problems clearly, not just relying on raw prompts.Cody De Arkland on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/codydearkland/ Rob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/Danny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/This Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabsThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMediaThis Dot Labs Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/This Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/This Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.socialSponsored by This Dot Labs: https://ai.thisdot.co</description>

      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/navigating-ai-bubble-10x-ai-engineer-cloudflare-vs-perplexity-data-grab</link>
      <description>Is the AI industry an unsustainable bubble built on burning billions in cash? We break down the AI hype cycle, the tough job market for developers, and whether a crash is on the horizon.
In this panel discussion with Josh Goldberg, Paige Niedringhaus, Paul Mikulskis, and Noel Minchow, we tackle the biggest questions in tech today. 
* We debate if AI is just another Web3-style hype cycle
* Why the &quot;10x AI engineer&quot; is a myth that ignores the reality of software development 
* The ethical controversy around AI crawlers and data scraping, highlighted by Cloudflare's recent actions
Plus, we cover the latest industry news, including Vercel's powerful new AI SDK V5 and what GitHub's leadership shakeup means for the future of developers.

      <title>React beyond the DOM: exploring custom renderers with Erik Rasmussen</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/react-beyond-the-dom-custom-renderers-erik-rasmussen</link>
      <description>Erik Rasmussen, principal product engineer at Attio, joins PodRocket to discuss how React can be used far beyond the web. From custom React renderers for IoT and hardware to a secure plugin architecture using iframes and JSON rendering, Erik dives into platform agnostic rendering, React reconciler, xState, and how Adio empowers developers to build third-party apps with React. A must-listen for anyone curious about React's future outside the DOM.
