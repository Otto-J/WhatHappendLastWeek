      <title>Episode 474: I hate the idea of firing a low performer and cheaper context switching</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/08/18/episode-474-i-hate-the-idea-of-firing-a-low-performer-and-cheaper-context-switching/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hi Dave &amp; Jamison,
Long time listener, first time google-form filler outer!
I work in a hybrid role as a lead developer and manager of a small team (less than 5). I’m new to management and most of ny experience so far has been with smart, motivated engineers. . .
UNTIL! My new recruit is driving me crazy, they are clearly very capable, but just do not do the work. They are frequently late for work, frequently sign off early, and constantly evasive when I ask for updates. I have spoken to them about these issues a bunch, and everytime they are apologetic and say they “have some personal issues but are working on it” - and nothing changes. Urgh!
I am pretty sure I will have to fire them, but I feel terrible about it! I know I can’t keep them on and pay them to do nothing, but what’s the best way to let somebody go? How do I break the news to the rest of the team? How do I avoid feeling bad for the rest of my life?
Yours guiltily,
Anon
A listener named “erm what the sigma” asks,
Do you have any advice on how to reduce the ramp-up time when context switching? I’ve always felt like context switching comes at a high cost for me—it just takes so long for me to mentally shift between tasks. This wasn’t much of a problem before, but I’ve recently become a tech lead and now my calendar is cluttered with meetings (why did I ask for this again??). I’m struggling to complete my coding stories because just as I hit my stride, I get pinged by someone on my team to help them or have to jump into yet another meeting. pls send help</description>

      <title>TanStack Devtools: One Panel to Rule Them All</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>You just can’t keep TanStack out of the news for more than a few weeks before a new product appears. This week, it’s TanStack Devtools, which provides a centralized devtools panel of all the Tanstack libraries for streamlined DX and custom devtools support.
The State of CSS 2025 survey results are in, and highlights include: devs love the new `:has()` feature, Tailwind CSS continues to be the most popular CSS framework, and over 60% of respondents are still using Sass or SCSS in their web apps.
Continuing the CSS topics, Panda CSS, a CSS-in-JS library that debuted in 2023, just hit v1. Panda gained traction by being a CSS-in-JS library built for the server-first era (meaning RSC support), and it adds new features like static analysis, type safety, and support for modern CSS like cascade layers, JSX style props, and a `createStyleContext` API for cross-framework design systems.
