      <title>Episode 479: Contractors to the rescue and dinged for delay</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/09/22/episode-479-contractors-to-the-rescue-and-dinged-for-delay/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hey skillet nation, long time skilletee first time skilleter here. I started at a scale up about 6 months ago and recently, I was asked to help with a project that was greatly behind schedule. The folks responsible for the original system are no longer at the company, and the team currently attempting to get it over the finish line have struggled greatly. The codebase is full of performance issues and the infrastructure was not set up to scale. Basically things are bad.
Since joining, I’ve helped draft a plan to fix most of the performance issues, and then incrementally improve the architecture. Things are going great, except for the fact that we’re 6 weeks out from our deadline with a burnt out dev team.
To resolve this, our CTO hast started to rapidly hire contractors to “help out”. As one might expect, this has only slowed us down. But our CTO, lacking trust in the previous team, has found the promises of the contractors very alluring. I, on the other hand, don’t love the idea of building this greenfield system with temporary workers and then dropping it on an already burnt out team to maintain.
Am I overreacting? How would yall handle this scenario? How can I convince our CTO that “the mythical man month” still applies here, regardless of what the contracting company says?
Listener k pop demon hunters asks,
Hello! I’m a senior engineer in a big tech company. I recently got a bad annual review from my manager due to the fact that I caused a delay happened in my last project. It was a compliance process involving multiple stakeholders and one of them didn’t give me an immediate approval for the step they owned. I promptly updated my submission for review after I got the initial feedback, pinged them in a messenger and sent a reminder mail every day until I got an approval from them. I feel absurd that I got a bad review due to the delay of external process. What could I have done this better?
Thanks for the great show. It’s making my commute more enjoyable. Keep it up!</description>

      <title>npm Under Siege: The “Shai-Hulud” Worm Attack</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>The supply chain attacks on npm continue and this week, Crowdstrike’s npm packages fell victim to the “Shai-Hulud” worm. 
To mitigate the potential of downloading these malicious packages, consider pinning specific package versions in JS projects and using 2FA to publish new package versions to npm.
Also this week, WebAssembly Specification (Wasm) released v3.0. This version dramatically expands the memory Wasm apps can use, supports multiple memory usage, and now allows garbage collection.
It’s been a while since we last covered LLM options for folks who want to run their own models locally or in the browser, so Jack gives a quick rundown of some of the best options out today. 
There’s WebLLM from MLC, MediaPipe from Google, and ONNX from Microsoft, and although none are easily interchangeable with another, if cost, privacy, or working offline are concerns of your LLM-enabled app, these may be good options to explore.
Chapter Markers:

00:58 - npm supply chain attack
16:28 - Wasm 3.0
23:34 - LLM options in the browser
34:41 - Jack’s experience at CascadiaJS and a discussion on the value of in-person conferences in 2025
41:54 - GitHub’s new MCP registry
43:26 - Microsoft Paint is getting project files
46:54 - What’s making us happy

      <title>Every AI Cloud-Native Expert Starts with Kubernetes | API Gateways vs Service Mesh Explained</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/modern-web/episodes/Every-AI-Cloud-Native-Expert-Starts-with-Kubernetes--API-Gateways-vs-Service-Mesh-Explained-e38ise1</link>
      <description>Danny Thompson sits down with Marino Wijay, Staff Solutions Architect at Kong and CNCF Ambassador, for a wide-ranging conversation on modern cloud-native development. They start with Kubernetes as the entry point into the ecosystem and explore what it really means to be a CNCF ambassador. Marino explains the difference between an API gateway and a service mesh, when small teams should adopt each, and why managed services often make more sense than running infrastructure yourself.The discussion then shifts to reliability and observability, with a focus on automation, pipelines, and creating a seamless developer experience. Finally, Marino shares lessons from working with enterprises rolling out AI, covering vector caching, cost optimization, latency concerns, and the importance of data governance when dealing with LLM traffic. It’s an episode full of practical advice for builders navigating the realities of APIs, microservices, and AI in production today.Key points from this episode:- Kubernetes remains the entry point into the cloud-native ecosystem, giving teams the foundation to operationalize applications and join the CNCF community.- Marino breaks down the distinction between an API gateway and a service mesh, showing how a gateway like Kong secures APIs at the edge while a mesh like Kuma manages traffic, authentication, and encryption between services.- For smaller teams, the smartest path is to rely on managed services and an API gateway, introducing a service mesh only when scale and complexity demand it.- As organizations adopt AI, Marino highlights how vector caching, governance policies, and PII sanitization help control costs, cut latency, and protect sensitive data when working with LLMs.Marino Wijay on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwijay/Rob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/Danny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/This Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabsThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMediaThis Dot Labs Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/This Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/This Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.socialSponsored by This Dot Labs: https://ai.thisdot.co/</description>

      <title>Google’s antitrust win, AI mandates, npm attacks and robots.txt</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/googles-antitrust-win-ai-mandates-npm-attacks-robots-txt</link>
      <description>Is the web breaking under the weight of AI crawlers, platform consolidation, and nonstop security breaches? We dive into the state of browsers, developer burnout, and whether tech regulation can actually keep up.
In this panel discussion:
We debate if robots.txt and AI licensing standards like RSL can realistically control how AI scrapes the web.
The fallout from DIA’s acquisition by Atlassian and what it means for indie browser innovation (like the Helium browser, Zen) in a Chromium-dominated world.
Why Google’s antitrust victory might embolden other tech giants, and what that means for competition.
How supply chain attacks like the NPM malware and Shai Hulud worm are exploiting GitHub workflows and package vulnerabilities.
The pushback against AI mandates at work, including Coinbase’s controversial policy requiring developers to use Copilot.

      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/unpacking-npm-supply-chain-attacks-feross-aboukhadijeh</link>
      <description>Feross Aboukhadijeh, founder of Socket, joins us to break down the recent wave of NPM supply chain attacks hitting the JavaScript ecosystem, including how attackers used phishing to target developers, snuck malware into popular packages like Prettier and &quot;is&quot;, and even abused tools like Claude, Gemini, and TruffleHog. 
We dig into how GitHub Actions vulnerabilities were exploited, what makes postinstall scripts risky, and and what you can do to protect yourself from future attacks.

      <title>The Comeback of RPC: SolidJS, TanStack, and the Future of JavaScript Frameworks with Ryan Carniato &amp; Tanner Linsley - JSJ 691</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/the-comeback-of-rpc-solidjs-tanstack-and-the-future-of-javascript-frameworks-with-ryan-carniato-tanner-linsley-jsj-691--67853663</link>
      <description>In this episode of JavaScript Jabber, I sit down with Ryan Carniato, creator of SolidJS, and Tanner Linsley, the force behind TanStack, for a deep-dive conversation on the resurgence of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in modern web development. We explore why RPC is making a comeback, how frameworks like Solid, TanStack, and others are shaping the way we think about data fetching, and the technical innovations that are driving this movement forward.
From streaming and serialization to type safety and the future of client-server communication, Ryan and Tanner share their experiences, insights, and the unique challenges they’ve faced building cutting-edge tools for developers. If you’ve been curious about where RPC fits in today’s frameworks—or just love geeking out about performance, signals, and developer experience—this is one episode you won’t want to miss.

Ryan Carniato
Ryan Carniato is the creator of SolidJS, a high-performance JavaScript framework built on fine-grained reactivity. He’s also a Senior Software Engineer at Sentry, where he explores new approaches to front-end architecture and developer experience. Through his open-source contributions, talks, and in-depth content, Ryan has become a trusted voice in the web development community, helping developers think differently about building fast, reactive applications.
Tanner Linsley
Tanner Linsley is the founder of TanStack, the home of widely adopted open-source libraries like TanStack Query (formerly React Query), TanStack Router, Table, Virtual, and more. A full-time open-source entrepreneur, Tanner has redefined how developers manage state, caching, and data fetching in modern applications. With a focus on performance, simplicity, and type safety, his tools power some of the most advanced applications on the web today.
