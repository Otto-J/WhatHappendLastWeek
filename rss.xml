tldraw
Have you ever wanted to build an app that works kinda like Miro or Figma, that has a zoomable infinite canvas, that’s multiplayer, and really good, but you also want to build it in React with normal React components on the canvas?

Good news! tldraw is the world’s first, best, and only SDK for building infinite canvas apps in React.

tldraw takes care of all the canvas complexities — things like the camera, selection logic, and undo redo — so that you can focus on building the features that matter to your users. It’s easy to use with plenty of examples and starter kits, including a kit where you can use AI to create things on the canvas.

Get started for free at tldraw.dev/shoptalk, or run npm create tldraw to spin up a starter kit.</description>

      <title>Episode 489: Ethical dilemma for a gambling app dev and ethical employers</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/12/01/episode-489-ethical-dilemma-for-a-gambling-app-dev-and-ethical-employers/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hey Jamison and Dave, love your show!
A question for you guys coming all the way from the Netherlands 🧀
I’ve started as a software engineer in a gambling company lately and the moral aspect of it bothers me a bit.
And while listening to you talking about the importance of accessibility in the last episode (#488) I came up with this moral dilemma: should a developer push for making a gambling app more accessible for users with disabilities or better not to? 😅
Thank you 🖤
Listener Arie Marie asks,
What are some good ways to research prospective employers to see if they have a strong commitment to ethical and human values? What are good questions to ask prospective employers during an interview? How can I be a developer and do what I love, and know that I’m not making the income inequality greater? How do you develop a lens to look at a company and discern it’s positive impact? How do you know if you’re making the world a better place?</description>

      <link>https://syntax.fm</link>
      <description>Wes and Scott talk about the weird, creative corners of the web—from live-coded music with Strudel and wild Hydra visuals to shader wizardry, projection-mapping art, fully synced Christmas lights, and more.

      <title>959: TypeScript on the GPU with TypeGPU creator Iwo Plaza</title>
      <link>https://syntax.fm/959</link>
      <description>Scott and CJ sit down live at JSNation NYC with Iwo Plaza, creator of TypeGPU, to dig into how WebGPU is unlocking a new wave of graphics and compute power on the web. They chat about shader authoring in TypeScript, the future of GPU-powered AI in the browser, and what it takes to build a killer developer-friendly graphics library.

00:00 Welcome to Syntax!


00:32 What is TypeGPU? High-level overview and why it exists


01:20 WebGPU vs WebGL – the new era of GPU access on the web


01:47 Why shader languages are hard + making them accessible


02:24 Iwo’s background in C++, OpenGL, and discovering JS


03:06 Sharing graphics work on the web vs native platforms


03:29 WebGPU frustrations that inspired TypeGPU


04:17 Making GPU–CPU data exchange easier with Zod-like schemas


05:01 Writing shaders in JavaScript + the unified type system


05:38 How the “use_gpu” directive works under the hood


06:05 Building a compiler that turns TypeScript into shader code


07:00 Type inference, primitives, structs, and TypeScript magic


08:21 Leveraging existing tooling via Unplugin + bundler integration


09:15 How TypeGPU extracts ASTs and generates TinyEST metadata


10:10 Runtime shader generation vs build-time macros


11:07 How the AST is traversed + maintaining transparency in output


11:43 Example projects like Jelly Shader and community reception


12:05 Brought to you by Sentry.io



12:30 Does TypeGPU replace 3JS? How it fits the existing ecosystem


13:20 Low-level control vs high-level abstractions


14:04 Upcoming Three.js integration – plugging TypeGPU into materials  compute shaders


15:34 Making GPU development more approachable


16:26 Docs, examples, and the philosophy behind TypeGPU documentation


17:03 Building features by building examples first


18:13 Using examples as a test suite + how docs shape API design


19:00 Docs as a forcing function for intuitive APIs


20:21 GPU for AI – browser inference and future abstractions


21:11 How AI examples inform new libraries (noise, inference, etc.)


21:57 Keeping the core package small and flexible


22:44 Building “TypeGPU AI”-style extensions without bloating the core


23:07 The cost of AI examples and building everything from scratch


23:41 Standard library design and future of the ecosystem


24:04 Closing thoughts from Iwo – OSS, GPU renaissance, and encouragement
