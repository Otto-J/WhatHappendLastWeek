      <title>Episode 485: I'm terrible at hiring decisions and my coworker spams us with AI-generated memes</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/11/03/episode-485-i'm-terrible-at-hiring-decisions-and-my-coworker-spams-us-with-ai-generated-memes/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
What signals do you look for when interviewing candidates? I’ve helped interview many people at this point and almost all of the engineers that I marked as “hire” that we brought on board ended up being low performers and were eventually managed out. I wasn’t the only one who approved them either, so not all the blame falls on me, but I’m really doubting my ability to assess talent.
Is hiring inherently just this difficult?
Is there anything I can do to improve my judgement or screening approach?
Hi Dave and Jamison,
A coworker on my team won’t stop creating AI generated memes.
We’re a remote team and every meeting he shares memes in the chat whilst we’re trying to have productive conversations. He does this in any type of meeting, including all-hands meetings with C-level execs. On smaller calls he often hijacks it to share his screen and show us a meme he just created about something that was just said.
It started off funny at first. But it’s now a constant distraction.
I find it frustrating because I don’t see how he can be paying attention and contributing to discussions when he’s busy making memes. And, I also don’t appreciate seeing AI versions of my own face being shared into public Slack channels.
How can I address this without sounding like I am anti-fun?
Love the show, been listening for many years, keep up the good work!</description>

      <title>120: Is the AI Bubble About to Burst?</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>It’s been almost 3 weeks since the React Compiler hit v1.0 and Jack gives an update on the ease of adding it to a React-based project and immediate performance improvement he’s seen from it. 
Popular AI-powered IDE Cursor just released v2.0, and it’s going hard on the agent mode, offering things like: a multi-agent interface where agents can run in parallel working on the same task with different models, and a new frontier model that’s 4x faster.
Then the hosts then get existential about whether the AI hype bubble is about to burst, if it’s really capable of stealing anyone’s jobs, and how much you should trust an LLM when making decisions about things like the tech stack for a new project. 
Timestamps:

1:43 - React Compiler 1.0
8:13 - Cursor 2.0
22:28 - AI discussion on bubbles and more
43:13 - What’s making us happy

News:

Paige - AI: bubbles and more bubbles, employment impact, and proper use
Jack - React Compiler 1.0
TJ - Cursor 2.0

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - Heated Under Desk Foot Rest
Jack - The Toxic Avenger movie
TJ - A London reporter interviewed the wrong Bill DeBlasio

      <title>Speeding up the web with the speculation rules API | Barry Pollard</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/barry-pollard</link>
      <description>Barry Pollard from the Chrome devrel team joins PodRocket to discuss the speculation rules API, a new browser feature designed to improve web performance through prefetch and pre-render techniques. Barry breaks down the history of speculative loading, contrasts SPA vs MPA behavior, and explains the nuances of hover prefetching, conservative prefetch, and the powerful new pre-render until script mode. Learn how Shopify and WordPress are adopting the API, what telemetry from Chrome Status reveals, and what developers need to know about potential pitfalls, caching behavior, and how the API is becoming a standard for static sites and e-commerce performance.
