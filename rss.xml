      <description>This week, Robbie and Adam talk with David K. Piano about state machines, the chaos of overusing React hooks, Tailwind controversies, AI agents, security risks in emerging AI tooling, and why determinism still matters. They also chat about pianos, creativity, and finding grounding outside of tech.
In this episode:

(06:54) - Hot Take: Is useState still dead to David?
(08:34) - Hot Take: Was class-based React better?
(11:12) - Tailwind tip: Don’t sleep on child selectors
(14:47) - Hot Take: Are HTML &amp; CSS programming languages?
(17:42) - Is Tailwind &quot; the worst state management library&quot;?
(22:24) - How a “simple boolean” exploded into a state tree
(24:13) - Debouncing, guarding, and timing transitions in state machines
(25:28) - Hot Take: Rails or Laravel
(26:19) - Why batteries-included frameworks struggle in JavaScript
(29:06) - Will AI push developers toward opinionated frameworks or away from them?
(34:44) - What Claude Skills are and why they matter
(36:47) - The newest AI hacks and whether you should be worried
(42:42) - Why David loves state machines (and how they keep AI on the rails)
(50:38) - David's love for the piano and having a non-tech hobby
(51:45) - What David would do if not in tech
(52:22) - Does playing an instrument make you a better programmer?
(57:39) - Plugs

      <description>Show Description
After a bit of gaming talk, Chris and Dave are sharing a bunch of cool projects that our Discord community members have been sharing over the past year including things like a web component based admin bar, shape CSS generators, new website portfolios, HTML-first web framework, email markup databases, miniature paintings, AI tools and ducks, and a lot more.
ShopTalk will be taking a break after this episode until the new year. Happy holidays for 2025 and we look forward to a great year in 2026 sharing our love of all things HTML, CSS, and building websites.

      <title>Episode 491: Re-arranging deck chairs on the Titantic and my boss leaks private info</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/12/15/episode-491-re-arranging-deck-chairs-on-the-titantic-and-my-boss-leaks-private-info/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
I handed in my resignation this past Monday. During the conversation, my manager confided in me that this coming Wednesday, 25% of the workforce is being laid off.
For context, this is the second round of layoffs. The first round happened a year ago and was a disaster. It was announced via an internal video the night before, but the CEO forgot to mention that the affected employees had already been notified privately. This caused mass panic; thinking they were next, many experienced engineers immediately brushed up their resumes and jumped ship voluntarily. Even my skip-level manager was in the dark. Shortly after that chaos, we were acquired by an American Private Equity firm.
Morale has been at an all-time low ever since, and the writing has been on the wall all year.
Now I am in the awkward position of serving my three-month notice period while walking through the ruins of my company. I am the “lucky one” who quit voluntarily two days before the hammer dropped to join a different company for a massive raise and promotion, while my colleagues are about to lose their jobs.
How do I navigate the next 90 days? How do I interact with the survivors who are likely furious and overworked, knowing I’m already checking out?
Sincerely,
Rearranging Deckchairs on the Titanic
Hello!
I have a bad manager, like really bad. She gets the whole team together to say “so and so is getting laid off tomorrow, or in a month, don’t say anything”.
She openly shares employee compensation in 1-1’s, gossips about her boss and team members and takes feedback as personal attacks.
Would you believe me if I said that no one trusts her?
What should I do? I want to contact HR but I have never talked to HR before in my career. I know I can’t tell her because engineers who have offered feedback on team dynamics, or general professionalism, get yelled in 1-1’s. Is this something worth taking to HR or do I just live with it until… I get a new job? If I do say something what do I say? Do I bring up the distrust she has created amongst the team or do I keep it to the poor judgement and unprofessionalism?
Do you want to write the letter for me? Yes!? Thanks!</description>

      <title>125: The RSC Vulnerabilities Keep Coming</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>Hot on the heels of the first critical vulnerability discovered in React applications using RSCs last week, two more vulnerabilities have surfaced, which is not uncommon. Even if you already updated for the critical vulnerability, you will need to update again.
In lighter news, Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation, just one year after introducing it to the world. MCP’s rise has been meteoric: 10,000 active public MCP servers, adoption by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, VS Code, and more, and now stewardship by the AAIF, which is under the Linux Foundation.
With all the great things coming to CSS lately, the Chrome Dev team created a great CSS Wrapped write up highlighting the big features for 2025. Of the 22 new features added, invoker commands, popover enhancements, and customizable select dropdowns are some of the most exciting additions.
Timestamps:

2:29 - More vulnerabilities in RSCs
6:36 - Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation
16:04 - CSS 2025 wrap up
25:05 - Disney to allow characters on Sora
29:42 - What’s making us happy

News:

Paige - Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation
Jack - More vulnerabilities in RSCs discovered
TJ - CSS Wrapped 2025

Lightning News: 

Disney will allow characters on Sora AI video generator

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - Twinkly Christmas Lights
Jack - 3D printed underwear for the multiboard desk organization
TJ - Mammoth

      <title>TanStack, TanStack Start, and what’s coming next with Tanner Linsley</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/tanstack-tanstack-start-and-whats-coming-next-with-tanner-linsley</link>
      <description>Jack Harrington sits down with Tanner Linsley to talk about the evolution of TanStack and where it’s headed next. They explore how early projects like React Query and React Table influenced the headless philosophy behind TanStack Router, why virtualized lists matter at scale, and what makes forms in React so challenging. Tanner breaks down TanStack Start and its client-first approach to SSR, routing, and data loading, and shares his perspective on React Server Components, modern authentication tradeoffs, and composable tooling. The episode wraps with a look at TanStack’s roadmap and what it takes to sustainably maintain open source at scale.

      <title>React got hacked with David Mytton</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/react2shell-javascript-security-wake-up-call-david-mytton</link>
      <description>In this episode, Noel sits down with David Mytton, founder and CEO of Arcjet, to unpack the React2Shell vulnerability and why it became such a serious remote code execution risk for apps using React server components and Next.js. They explain how server-side features introduced in React 19 changed the attack surface, why cloud providers leaned on WAF mitigation instead of instant patching, and what this incident reveals about modern JavaScript supply chain risk. The conversation also covers dependency sprawl, rushed patches, and why security as a feature needs to start long before production.
