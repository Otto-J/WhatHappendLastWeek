Have you ever wanted to build an app that works kinda like Miro or Figma, that has a zoomable infinite canvas, that’s multiplayer, and really good, but you also want to build it in React with normal React components on the canvas?

Good news! tldraw is the world’s first, best, and only SDK for building infinite canvas apps in React.

tldraw takes care of all the canvas complexities — things like the camera, selection logic, and undo redo — so that you can focus on building the features that matter to your users. It’s easy to use with plenty of examples and starter kits, including a kit where you can use AI to create things on the canvas.

Get started for free at tldraw.dev/shoptalk, or run npm create tldraw to spin up a starter kit.</description>

      <title>Episode 488: How do I survive in a culture of optics and jira slacker</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/11/24/episode-488-how-do-i-survive-in-a-culture-of-optics-and-jira-slacker/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hey Dave and Jamison,
Big fan of the show — listening from Portugal! (Proof that even across the Atlantic, software politics are universal.)
I’m a tech lead, and lately I’ve noticed a culture where people seem to care way more about how things look than what actually gets done. It’s like the appearance of productivity matters more than real impact. Honestly, it drives me nuts!!
I know politics are part of any organization, and way more in a leadership role, but this feels excessive. As someone who values substance and solid engineering, how do I deal with or influence this kind of culture without losing my sanity (or turning into one of those “optics-first” people myself)?
Thanks for all the insights and laughs. Kudos from Portugal!
Listener Charlie says,
I’m fresh out of college at my first software engineering job. Several months ago I was appointed the accessibility champion for my team. I proposed a few items in the quarterly planning session, but I think it wasn’t enough. My project manager called out our whole team, but I think it was mostly aimed at me.
I’ve been struggling with creating Jira cards, shaping with the team, writing a11y guidelines, etc. It’s tedious and I’m not really familiar with this kind of work. How can I get better at the “other stuff” besides just writing code?
P.S. I volunteered for this responsibility 😩</description>

      <title>123: Is Google’s Antigravity IDE a Game-Changer or Just Another Fork?</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>Another week, another new AI IDE. This week, Google released the Antigravity IDE (yet another VS Code fork) which offers unique twists like “cross-surface” agents, user feedback to agent-generated artifacts, and a view of all agents across any workspace.
The team behind the Unistyles cross-platform library just debuted Uniwind for all the React Native devs who want to use Tailwind styling in their native apps. Uniwind brings Tailwind-style className support to RN at build time, and has a custom, high-performance CSS parser to handle both Tailwind 4 and plain CSS files. 
Prisma 7.0 is out, and so is Rust from its codebase. The team completely rebuilt it in TypeScript to cut down on its bundle size and the communication layer between Rust and the JS runtime that was actually slower than just JavaScript through and through.
In Lightning News, even if you don’t develop in Angular, the Angular v21 dev release video is worth a watch, Cloudflare had a big Internet outage this week, Firefox has teased AI in its browser “the Firefox way”, and the State of React Survey 2025 is open now (please vote for Front-end Fire in the Podcasts section!).

      <description>En este episodio hablamos de los pasos cruciales del desarrollo de software que ninguna IA puede reemplazar, como entender el problema, planear, validar y alinear expectativas. Y también del caos que ocurre cuando alguien cree que la IA puede hacerlo por ellos.</description>

      <title>The useless useCallback: React performance myths unpacked, with Dominik Dorfmeister (Repeat)</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/the-useless-usecallback-react-performance-myths-dominik-dorfmeister-repeat</link>
      <description>In this repeat episode, Dominik Dorfmeister unpacks the pitfalls of React’s useCallback and useMemo, revealing how these hooks often introduce more complexity than performance gains. He explores the promise of the React Compiler, the practical power of the “latest ref” pattern, and strategies to boost code readability and maintainability at scale.
Learn why overusing useEffect and manual memoization can do more harm than good, and how teams can level up their PR reviews and performance practices using tools like the ESLint React Compiler plugin.
