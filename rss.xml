      <title>We Accidentally Deleted Programming (Presented by CodeRabbit)</title>
      <link>https://whiskey.fm</link>
      <description>This week, Robbie and Adam sip on Whistle Pig's Liquid Death collaboration and debate whether we've accidentally deleted programming itself. They dig into the shift from code-first to spec-first development, whether TypeScript still matters in an AI-driven world, the rise of agency over specialization, and why the future might belong to prompt-driven tinkerers instead of traditional developers.

Presented by CodeRabbit: http://coderabbit.link/whiskey

In this episode:





(00:00) - Intro



(01:43) - Whiskey rating &amp; review: Whistle Pig x Liquid Death Gravestock



(07:21) - Automating tasks with AI: the chicken and egg problem



(11:12) - Building a whiskey episode art generator with Swift and AI



(17:02) - Libraries that ship specs instead of code



(22:24) - Is TypeScript still worth it in an AI-first world?



(29:06) - Converting Shepherd from Svelte to Solid for bundle size

      <description>Show Description
We're passing over another milestone episode and answering your Q's with our A's while we do it: Dave goes 3D printing, should CSS be inside a web component, Chris is trying to build web component for popovers, why isn't Vue used or talked about more, finding bugs in blocks in the new CodePen, and we're grateful for 700 episodes.

      <title>130: TanStack Start Embraces RSC—Minus the Security Nightmares </title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>You heard it here first, folks, RSC support is now available in TanStack Start! Since TanStack Start supports not only React but also Solid, it handles serialization differently, meaning the critical security vulnerabilities RSC-enabled React apps have been suffering from lately won’t affect TanStack apps.
Yarn 6 was recently announced, and (surprise, surprise) it’s going to be ported to Rust. Get ready for blazing fast installs, the ability to easily switch between Yarn versions, and lazy installs to silently keep dependency versions in sync with the package.json. 
Also on the Rust bandwagon is the VoidZero team with Rolldown 1.0 RC. Rolldown is the bundler successor to Rollup, and boasts 10-30x faster speeds than Rollup while maintaining API plugin compatibility, built-in transforms, and native CJS/ESM interoperability. All hail the perf gains of JS tools written in Rust.
Timestamps:

1:20 - TanStack Start RSC
4:15 - Yarn 6 and Rust
12:03 - Rolldown 1.0 RC
16:38 - More RSC CVEs
23:19 - Mozilla is building an AI “rebel alliance”
30:05 - What’s making us happy

News:

Paige - Rolldown 1.0 RC
Jack - TanStack Start RSC
TJ - Yarn 6 and Rust

Lightning News: 

Another day, another RSC CVE
Mozilla’s building an AI “rebel alliance”

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - Landman season 2
Jack - Vaseline
TJ - ChatGPT continuing to help me around the house

      <title>The LLM Doomer Episode</title>
      <link>https://share.transistor.fm/s/5888162b</link>
      <description>Sorry about Jeppe's audio in this one, he accidentally picked the wrong microphone during recording and there's not much we can do about it :(
The gang kicks back for their first episode of the new year, catching up on holidays before diving into AI and vibe coding. Kevin talks bout a gym tracking app he built almost entirely with LLMs. 
They cover updates to the Svelte Society website (job board, sponsorships, newsletter), debate whether Mozilla/Firefox can survive by pivoting to AI, and wrap with hot takes: Kevin warns devs to learn AI tools or risk obsolescence, Brittney shares Claude's take that TypeScript's type system has become its own technical debt, and Jeppe champions the glory of two ultra-wide curved monitors.</description>

      <title>Rich Harris on fine grained reactivity and async first frameworks</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/rich-harris-on-fine-grained-reactivity-and-async-first-frameworks</link>
      <description>Rich Harris joins the podcast to discuss his talk, fine-grained everything, exploring fine-grained reactivity, frontend performance, and the real costs of React Server Components and RSC payloads. Rich explains how Svelte and SvelteKit approach co-located data fetching, remote functions, and RPC to reduce server-side rendering costs, improve developer experience, and avoid unnecessary performance overhead on mobile networks. The conversation dives into async rendering, parallel async data fetching, type safety with schema validation, and why async-first frameworks may define the future of JavaScript frameworks and web performance.

Modern front-end frameworks like Svelte are astonishingly fast at rendering, thanks to techniques such as signal-based fine-grained reactivity. But there's more to performance than updating the screen at 60 frames per second. In this talk, we'll learn about new approaches that help you build fast, reliable, data-efficient apps.
