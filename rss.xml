      <title>Episode 484: How to get a raise after slacking off for YEARS and my PM won't stop DM'ing me</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/10/27/episode-484-how-to-get-a-raise-after-slacking-off-for-years-and-my-pm-won't-stop-dm'ing-me/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hi! Love your show and how casually you talk and make fun of everything! I started my career as a freelancer and then joined a mid-size software development company to learn how the sausage is really made, salary wasn’t that important back then. A few kids and a lot more expensive lifestyle later the compensation has become more motivating, but I’m not sure how to sell myself to my manager if I don’t feel like I deserve a high salary myself. (The manager decides the salaries for all our team members.) For years I’ve been focusing on my family and other life stuff, so I’ve spent a looot of working hours not working and basically doing the minimum progress acceptable. Slow progress has come up once with my manager, from which I wiggled out of with various excuses. I’ve realised that this way of working isn’t really fair for the company and my teammates and I’ve started to take this job and my career seriously in the last few months. The company and everyone working there are super supportive and it’s been a terrific experience for all of those years. I’ve gotten a raise multiple times with always me initiating that conversation. There aren’t any clear metrics to improve that directly ties to the salary: I’ve asked my manager about it and the answer was vague like “we have this local salary survey that we take as the base and work from there”. So long story short: how to ask for a raise while not feeling like a criminal since I feel like I haven’t earned the salary I had thus far?
I’m a team lead who’s growing increasingly frustrated with my project manager. Every planning conversation ends up in my private DMs, no matter how many times I’ve asked him to move these discussions to the team chat.
When he messages me one-on-one, my team loses visibility into decisions, questions don’t get addressed openly, and important context just evaporates. It’s not only slowing us down, it also makes me feel like the burden of relaying everything falls squarely on me.
I’ve tried gently redirecting him back to the shared space, but he keeps defaulting to my DMs. How can I get him to respect the boundaries of team communication without damaging our working relationship?
Sincerely,
Lost in the PM’s DMs</description>

      <title>119: Vercel’s Double Feature—Next.js 16 and Ship AI</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>Another week, another new AI-browser. This time it’s OpenAI’s turn to introduce ChatGPT Atlas. As with the other AI browsers, Atlas knows the context of open tabs, has an agent that can do things for you, and (maybe its defining feature) it has &quot;memory&quot; built in so conversations can draw on past chats and details when needed.
The team behind Vite reveals their path to revenue with command line devtool Vite+. Devs will soon be able to test, lint, format, bundle, and even view their apps’ stats with Vite+, with the performance we expect from a compiler toolchain built completely in Rust. Plus, it’s free for individual users and OSS projects, and has annual licensing prices for startups and enterprises.
Vercel held not one but two conferences this week: Next.js Conf and then Ship AI. Next.js 16 was unveiled with improvements to Turbopack, a Next.js DevTools MCP, and updates to Cache Components. And Ship AI covered updates to the AI SDK, Vercel’s AI Gateway and Agents, and more. 
Chapter Markers:

02:05 - ChatGPT Atlas
12:38 - Vite+

      <title>Andrew Gazdecki on the best way to sell your indie SaaS business</title>
      <link>https://indiebites.com/130</link>
      <description>Andrew Gazdecki is the founder of Acquire, previously known as MicroAcquire, the largest startup acquisition marketplace. I’ve spoken to many indie hackers about selling their businesses, many of whom have done so using Andrew’s platform. Before starting the Acquire, Andrew spent 8 years bootstrapping Bizness Apps to $10m ARR before being acquired by a private equity firm. You might also know of Boostrappers.com, the site Andrew started, sharing stories of bootstrappers. Finally, he also wrote a book called Getting Acquired, which tells his story and outlines exactly how you can sell your business.

      <title>Benchmarking AI with Stanislav Khromov</title>
      <link>https://share.transistor.fm/s/b519e6cc</link>
      <description>In this episode, Stanislav Khromov joins the Svelte Radio team to discuss his work on Svelte Bench, a
benchmarking tool that scientifically measures how well different LLMs understand and write Svelte 5 code.
The conversation explores the challenges of AI-assisted coding with Svelte 5, the development of the official
Svelte MCP (Model Context Protocol) that provides LLMs with documentation and auto-fixing capabilities, and
the surprising performance differences between major AI providers. Stanislav also shares insights on working
with AI tools, the future of local models, and the economics of AI coding assistants.

      <title>Remix v3, React 19.2, H-1B fees and Firefox fanboys</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/2025</link>
      <description>This months panel dives into Remix v3 without React, exploring its DIY VDOM framework and manual reactivity approach. We discuss the latest React Foundation governance changes and what React 19.2 brings, from the Activity component to useEffectEvent and server streaming support. The conversation also covers how the proposed H-1B $100,000 fee could affect tech hiring, thoughts on Firefox, the Perplexity and Washington Post paywall, and a spicy Tailwind vs CSS debate.

      <itunes:summary>This months panel dives into Remix v3 without React, exploring its DIY VDOM framework and manual reactivity approach. We discuss the latest React Foundation governance changes and what React 19.2 brings, from the Activity component to useEffectEvent and server streaming support. The conversation also covers how the proposed H-1B $100,000 fee could affect tech hiring, thoughts on Firefox, the Perplexity and Washington Post paywall, and a spicy Tailwind vs CSS debate.

      <title>Guarding the JavaScript Supply Chain: Preventing NPM Attacks with Feross Aboukhadijeh - JSJ 695</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/guarding-the-javascript-supply-chain-preventing-npm-attacks-with-feross-aboukhadijeh-jsj-695--68374172</link>
      <description>Hey everyone—it’s Steve Edwards here, and in this episode of JavaScript Jabber, I’m joined by returning guest Feross Aboukhadijeh, founder of Socket.dev, for a deep dive into the dark and fascinating world of open source supply chain security. From phishing campaigns targeting top NPM maintainers to the now-infamous Chalk library compromise, we unpack the latest wave of JavaScript package attacks and what developers can learn from them.
Feross explains how some hackers are even using AI tools like Claude and Gemini as part of their payloads—and how defenders like Socket are fighting back with AI-powered analysis of their own. We also dive into GitHub Actions vulnerabilities, the role of two-factor authentication, and the growing need for “phishing-resistant 2FA.” Whether you’re an open source maintainer or just someone who runs npm install a little too often, this episode will open your eyes to how much happens behind the scenes to keep your code safe.
