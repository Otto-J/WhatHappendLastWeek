      <title>Is AI Just Stealing with Extra Steps? (Presented by CodeRabbit)</title>
      <link>https://whiskey.fm</link>
      <description>This week, Robbie and Adam talk about the ethics and economics of AI, and why “stealing with extra steps” feels like the right metaphor for where things are headed. They dig into open source burnout, whether AI replaces developers or just reshapes the job, how tooling and multi-agent systems fit in, and whether the future belongs to niche expertise—or just better prompts.

Presented by CodeRabbit: http://coderabbit.link/whiskey

      <title>Episode 497: Patronizing perf reviews and can't get anything done as a tech lead</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2026/01/26/episode-497-patronizing-perf-reviews-and-can't-get-anything-done-as-a-tech-lead/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
I’m a relatively new people manager and I really struggle when it comes time for performance reviews, or even regular praise or critical feedback in one-on-ones, because I can’t help feeling like an adult “talking down” to another adult, regardless of whether the feedback is generally positive or critical and instructive. Something about it all seems so patronizing to me. How can I approach this stuff with a different mindset?
Hello D &amp; J! Quick one from your biggest fan!! This week (Tuesday 6th Jan 2k26) I was promoted to Tech Lead of our team. In my new role, I have done no work *cries*, I’ve spent all my time assisting team members, unblocking QA, dealing with ad hoc requests from product/stakeholders…. I asked the previous tech lead is this what they did? They did! And they said spent their personal time to complete stories assigned to them.
Is this really what a tech lead does?!?!! Helpppp</description>

      <title>129: The Era of Humans Writing Code is Over </title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>jQuery is the JavaScript library that just won’t quit. 20 years after its inception the team released jQuery 4.0.0, and it brings some notable modernizations including removed support for IE 10, a migration to ES modules, and support for Trusted Types. 
Node.js creator Ryan Dahl declared earlier this week that “the era of humans writing code is over”, and considering how good AI coding agents have gotten lately, he’s probably not wrong. 
Cloudflare also announces it has acquired popular JavaScript framework Astro. Cloudflare has been a good steward to other OSS projects in the past, and this acquisition allows the Astro team to focus on making the framework even better.
Timestamps:

0:50 - jQuery 4.0
7:58 - Is the era of humans writing code over?
18:23 - Cloudflare acquires Astro
24:54 - Vertical tabs are coming to Chrome
29:37 - Apple is going to use Gemini for Siri
43:07 - What’s making us happy

News:

Paige - Ryan Dahl declares humans writing code is over
Jack - Cloudflare acquires Astro
TJ - jQuery 4.0

Lightning News: 

Chrome adds support for vertical tabs
Apple and Google enter agreement to use Gemini for Apple Intelligence

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - Onyx Storm book
Jack - Learning to play Born to Run on guitar
TJ - Only Murders in the Building TV series and Dungeon Crawler Carl book series

      <description>This week we're joined by Salma Alam-Naylor, the Head of Developer Education at Nordcraft. Salma shares her journey from music teacher to developer, her discovery of the developer education space in 2020, and the challenges and opportunities she's faced in her role.

      <title>Tailwind Layoffs, Cloudflare Buys Astro | Panel</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/tailwind-layoffs-cloudflare-buys-astro-ai-reshaping-dev-tooling</link>
      <description>In this mini-panel, Jack, Paige, Paul, and Noel discuss how AI reshaping developer tooling is impacting open source monetization, including the recent Tailwind layoffs and the collapse of Tailwind documentation traffic caused by AI. The conversation expands into broader developer tooling business models and reacts to claims like Ryan Dahl stating that the era of humans writing code is over.
They also cover the Astro Cloudflare acquisition, what it means for the Cloudflare developer platform, and how this shapes the frontend frameworks future. Hot takes include light mode vs dark mode SaaS, shifting developer aesthetics, and why AI productivity for developers may now come down to workflow design rather than raw coding skill.

      <description>It’s great to be back behind the mic! In this episode of JavaScript Jabber, I’m joined by Dan Shapir and our guest Jack Harrington from Netlify and TanStack for a wide-ranging, high-energy conversation that covers everything from modern frontend architecture to AI tooling—and a few entertaining detours along the way.
We dig into what’s new and exciting in the TanStack ecosystem, including TanStack Start and TanStack AI, and explore how these tools rethink the balance between frontend-first development and server-side capabilities. Along the way, we unpack React Server Components, AI SDKs, agentic workflows, and how developers can realistically use AI today without losing their minds—or their context windows.
