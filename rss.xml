      <title>Episode 477: Four months and I already hate my job and grumpy and fuzzy</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2025/09/08/episode-477-four-months-and-i-already-hate-my-job-and-grumpy-and-fuzzy/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hey guys,
I have been working for four months at my job and I already don’t like it.
This is my first job out of college and I work as a C# backend engineer for a small B2B SaaS company. I really think this company is a dead end. There is a lot of technical debt and antipatterns and we have no automated testing whatsoever. Most of our time is spent manually debugging but no one wants to refactor.
I’m already thinking about working somewhere else. However, it took me a while to get this job, and I don’t think the market has gotten any better since. I’m trying to decide whether I should focus on applying to jobs again or if I should work on a bunch of side projects and open source to stand out better. On one hand, I can learn new technologies on my own to make me stand out for my next job, but on the other hand,
I feel like as long as I stay at this company I am wasting time, since I’m not learning from my job. I want to switch to more distributed backend engineering in Java anyways, but I’m not sure how to go about it.
Listener Ghani asks,
“I’m a mid-level software engineer who has trouble communicating with my engineering manager and product manager when there is unclear or missing information about an assignment/story/project.
They answer with hostile/dismissive tone/non-answer (e.g it’s on the jira-card, epic, etc). They course correct when they have the information later, harshly
my impressions were
they don’t have the information at the time
they expect engineers to make decision
they expect engineers to know something they don’t (e.g architecture, infrastructure, past decision, plans, etc)
I really want to look for where we can have a safe exchange of information. How can I do this?</description>

      <title>Warp Code and the Future of Agent-Driven Dev</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>The Google vs. the US anti-trust lawsuit has finally drawn to a close, and (spoiler alert) Google doesn’t have to sell Chrome (or Android, for that matter). Going forward it will have to share certain search data with its rivals, and that’s about it, so this is definitely a big win for Google any way you look at it.
The popular terminal company Warp just unveiled Warp Code - a suite of features for shipping agent-generated code “all the way from prompt to production” via the Warp terminal. Warp Code offers an agent-driven terminal-first approach, with visual code review of agent changes, and a native file editor for minor edits in an attempt to eliminate the context switching devs have to do nowadays between their AI agents, IDEs, and GitHub. 
In a twist no one saw coming, SaaS behemoth Atlassian has bought AI-browser Dia (and its maker The Browser Company) for $610 million. Atlassian wants to position Dia as the AI-browser for users at work and time will tell if that bet pays off.

      <title>Software Developers Spill the Beans on Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/modern-web/episodes/Software-Developers-Spill-the-Beans-on-Conversational-AI-e37vsjc</link>
      <description>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson are joined by Rishab Kumar, Staff Developer Evangelist at Twilio, to explore the evolving landscape of voice and AI interactions. They discuss the rise of conversational AI, how voice interfaces are becoming the natural medium for human-computer interaction, and the tools and best practices for integrating AI into real-world applications. Rishab shares insights from Twilio on building voice-enabled AI experiences, tackling challenges like latency and prompt design, and how AI is shaping the future of productivity and problem-solving. The conversation also highlights community-focused events, like the upcoming Commit Your Code Conference in Dallas, where networking, learning, and giving back to charity take center stage.


Key Takeaways:
- Voice interfaces are becoming more natural and conversational, moving beyond simple commands to context-aware, agentic interactions that can assist with tasks in real time.
- AI is being integrated into real-world use cases, from coding assistants and productivity tools to hands-on guidance for tasks like furniture assembly, car troubleshooting, and lab work.
- Platforms like Twilio provide APIs, Conversation Relay, and integrations with voice models to streamline AI voice interactions, handling challenges like latency, speech-to-text, and interruption management.
- There’s a growing need for specialized, reliable AI tools tailored to specific industries and tasks, as well as careful consideration of ethical implications, user trust, and contextual accuracy.

- AI is being integrated into real-world use cases, from coding assistants and productivity tools to hands-on guidance for tasks like furniture assembly, car troubleshooting, and lab work.
- Platforms like Twilio provide APIs, Conversation Relay, and integrations with voice models to streamline AI voice interactions, handling challenges like latency, speech-to-text, and interruption management.
- There’s a growing need for specialized, reliable AI tools tailored to specific industries and tasks, as well as careful consideration of ethical implications, user trust, and contextual accuracy.

      <title>Modularizing the monolith with Jimmy Bogard</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/modularizing-monolith-jimmy-bogard</link>
      <description>Jimmy Bogard joins Pod Rocket to talk about making monoliths more modular, why boundaries matter, and how to avoid turning systems into distributed monoliths. From refactoring techniques and database migrations at scale to lessons from Stripe and WordPress, he shares practical ways to balance architecture choices. We also explore how tools like Claude and Lambda fit into modern development and what teams should watch for with latency, transactions, and growing complexity.

      <title>Exploring Vibe Coding and the Future of Product Management with Gunnar Berger - JSJ 690</title>
      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/exploring-vibe-coding-and-the-future-of-product-management-with-gunnar-berger-jsj-690--67736475</link>
      <description>In this episode of JavaScript Jabber, I sit down with Amazon product leader Gunnar Berger to dive into the fast-evolving world of vibe coding and how it’s reshaping the relationship between developers and product managers. Gunnar brings a wealth of experience from his years in IT, Citrix, and now Amazon, and shares a unique perspective on how AI tools are changing the way products get built—from idea to prototype.
We talk about the shifting role of product managers, how AI is compressing traditional workflows, and what it means for developers, UX designers, and even junior devs entering the industry. From rapid prototyping to AI-assisted documentation, Gunnar opens up about both the opportunities and the challenges this new paradigm introduces. Whether you’re a developer, product manager, or just curious about where AI is taking us, this conversation is packed with insights you won’t want to miss.
