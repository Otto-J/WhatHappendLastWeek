          "showNotes": "You heard it here first, folks, RSC support is now available in TanStack Start! Since TanStack Start supports not only React but also Solid, it handles serialization differently, meaning the critical security vulnerabilities RSC-enabled React apps have been suffering from lately won’t affect TanStack apps.\nYarn 6 was recently announced, and (surprise, surprise) it’s going to be ported to Rust. Get ready for blazing fast installs, the ability to easily switch between Yarn versions, and lazy installs to silently keep dependency versions in sync with the package.json. \nAlso on the Rust bandwagon is the VoidZero team with Rolldown 1.0 RC. Rolldown is the bundler successor to Rollup, and boasts 10-30x faster speeds than Rollup while maintaining API plugin compatibility, built-in transforms, and native CJS/ESM interoperability. All hail the perf gains of JS tools written in Rust.\nTimestamps:\n\n1:20 - TanStack Start RSC\n4:15 - Yarn 6 and Rust\n12:03 - Rolldown 1.0 RC\n16:38 - More RSC CVEs\n23:19 - Mozilla is building an AI “rebel alliance”\n30:05 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - Rolldown 1.0 RC\nJack - TanStack Start RSC\nTJ - Yarn 6 and Rust\n\nLightning News: \n\nAnother day, another RSC CVE\nMozilla’s building an AI “rebel alliance”\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Landman season 2\nJack - Vaseline\nTJ - ChatGPT continuing to help me around the house\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

Rich explains how Svelte and SvelteKit approach co-located data fetching, remote functions, and RPC to reduce server-side rendering costs, improve developer experience, and avoid unnecessary performance overhead on mobile networks. The conversation dives into async rendering, parallel async data fetching, type safety with schema validation, and why async-first frameworks may define the future of JavaScript frameworks and web performance.\nLinks\nX: https://x.com/Rich_Harris\nhttps://github.com/rich-harris\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/rich-harris.dev\nResources\nModern front-end frameworks like Svelte are astonishingly fast at rendering, thanks to techniques such as signal-based fine-grained reactivity. But there's more to performance than updating the screen at 60 frames per second. In this talk, we'll learn about new approaches that help you build fast, reliable, data-efficient apps.\nSlides: https://fine-grained-everything.vercel.app/1-1\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us?
