          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHi Dave and Jamison,\nAfter fleeing a sinking ship of a startup, I became a solo developer at a medium sized college. This role has really allowed me to expand and grow in ways that I haven’t imagined, but I have encountered an interesting issue I didn’t have in the startup world: there isn’t much to do.\nAt my one year mark, I was promoted into a management position, but with no direct report. I will soon have an employee under me doing data integrations. My manager has been reluctant to give me data integrations work despite knowing that I want to understand what my employee will be working with.\nI’ve found some of my own projects, but I’ve completed them all. I’m getting bored. I’m a competent developer, learn fast, and get things done quickly. Recently I’ve been planning an upgrade to some of our legacy code, but it will take probably a year or more to complete.\nSome former colleagues reached out about working with them for a substantial pay bump, but I don’t like the idea of leaving after just over a year and a half. Do I keep riding it out here, or is it time to start looking else where?\nThank you both for this wonderful podcast. Its a joy to listen to on my walks. I’m sure I get stared at when I try to hide a laugh or grin from the amazing list of Patron names and your commentary.\nI was recently terminated a few months before my 1 year vesting cliff as an IC2 for being days (not weeks) late on 3 or 4 stories. The late ones were defined incorrectly by management, or were for paying technical debt created by senior engineers, and my manager knew this. I had no IC2 or IC1 peers on my team for comparison. My performance review for the first half of 2025 was not released to me, I was fired when I would have seen it. This means the only reasoning that management has shared with me was my late work. In 1 on 1s before, my lateness has been something my manager has mentioned, but never a warning of termination (or a “pip” as some call it) and no indication that it’s anything more than an area to improve. The org has made poor decisions that left them tight on funds, and I feel the most financially responsible thing for them to do was fire me rather than give me a warning which would let me hit my cliff or lay me off where they’d give more on my way out.\nHad I been pipped or laid off, I would not be asking about this. Should I go with the confusing justification that my boss was truthful in his attribution of my firing without warning to my lateness (and can you help me understand why that’s professionally justified)? Should I go with the disheartening approach and brainstorm other shortcomings that would better justify an unwarned firing, possibly spurring professional growth or a career change? Or should I say I got instafired because of penny pinching and opaque management?",

There’s a new a native VS Code extension, a v2 of the terminal version of Claude, code checkpoints, and it’s all powered by Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic’s best coding model yet.\nOn top of Claude’s glow up, the Google Chrome team launched a Chrome DevTools MCP. AI coding assistants will be able to debug web pages directly in a Chrome browser, including using DevTools to review network requests, console output and page structure, simulate user interactions, and even automate performance audits.\nIn a poorly planned move, the CEO of Vercel tweeted a picture of himself meeting with the controversial Israeli Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. This sparked a massive online backlash, some Vercel employees quit, and many customers are leaving the hosting site and vowing to stop using Next.js, as well. \nTimestamps:\n\n00:46 - Claude Sonnet and Claude Code updates\n7:55 - Chrome DevTools MCP\n13:50 - Vercel Drama\n19:03 - State of JS survey is open\n20:21 - GitHub’s plan to make npm more secure\n25:30 - Meta builds data center the size of 70 football fields\n29:04 - What’s making us happy\n\nLinks:\n\nPaige - Chrome DevTools MCP\nJack - Vercel’s in hot water after a selfie with Benjamin Netanyahu\nTJ - Claude Code levels up\nState of JS survey is open\nGitHub’s got a plan to make npm more secure\nMeta builds AI data center the size of 70 football fields\nPaige - Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3\nJack - reactnorway.com\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

          "showNotes": "In this Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson break down the recent string of NPM supply chain attacks that have shaken the JavaScript ecosystem. They cover the NX compromise, the phishing campaign that hit libraries like Chalk, and the Shy Halood exploit, showing how small changes in dependencies can have massive effects. Along the way, they share practical defenses like using package lock and npm ci, avoiding phishing links, reviewing third party code, applying least privilege, staging deployments, and maintaining incident response plans. They also highlight vendor interventions such as Vercel blocking malicious deployments and stress why companies must support open source maintainers if the ecosystem is to remain secure.\n\n\nKey Points from this Episode:\n- Lock down installs. Pin versions, commit package-lock.json, use npm ci in CI, and disable scripts in CI (npm config set ignore-scripts true) to neutralize post-install attacks.\n- Harden people & permissions. Phishing hygiene (never click-through emails), 2FA/hardware keys, least-privilege by default, and separate/purpose-scoped publishing accounts.\n- Stage & detect early. Canary/staged deploys, feature flags, and tight observability to catch dependency drift, suspicious network egress, or monkey-patched APIs fast.\n- Practice incident response. Two-hour containment target: revoke/rotate tokens, reimage affected machines, roll back artifacts, notify vendors, and run a post-mortem playbook.\n\n\nRob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/\nDanny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/\nThis Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabs\nThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMedia\nThis Dot Labs Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/\nThis Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/\nThis Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.social\n\n\nSponsored by This Dot Labs: https://ai.thisdot.co/",

The conversation\ncovers the technical implementation, design decisions, and future possibilities including caching, streaming, and\nintegration with Svelte's upcoming resource API. Simon also explains how async Svelte enables top-level await\nin components with coordinated loading boundaries, making asynchronous work much easier to manage in both\nSSR and SPA contexts.\n\nLinks\n\nRemote Functions Documentation\nRemote Functions Video by Simon\nFollow-up Video by Simon\n\nPicks\n\nSimon: Elgato Wave Microphone\nKevin: CalDigit Thunderbolt 5 Dock TS5 Plus",

We dive into how Kiro takes “AI-assisted coding” to a new level through spec-driven development — a process that focuses on defining requirements and collaborating with AI to break projects into clear, manageable tasks.\nWe unpack what sets Kiro apart from tools like Cursor and Copilot, explore its supervised vs. autopilot coding modes, and even talk about how it handles UI design, planning, and complex legacy codebases. Clare and Erik share behind-the-scenes insights on how Kiro was built using Kiro itself, what’s coming next for the platform, and how developers can join the early-access community to help shape its future.\n🔗 Links & Resources:\n\n🌐 Kiro Official Site\n🧠 AWS Developer Advocate Team\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
