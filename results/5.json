They dig into open source burnout, whether AI replaces developers or just reshapes the job, how tooling and multi-agent systems fit in, and whether the future belongs to niche expertise—or just better prompts.\n\nPresented by CodeRabbit: http://coderabbit.link/whiskey\n\nIn this episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n(00:00) - Intro\n\n\n\n(01:56) - Whiskey rating & review: Old Forester 1897\n\n\n\n(04:50) - Music taste, Spotify ages, and feeling old\n\n\n\n(07:29) - Is AI just stealing with extra steps?\n\n\n\n(19:09) - Ralph vs. Gastown and the rise of agent chaos\n\n\n\n(28:04) - What is an AI harness?\n\n\n\n(31:36) - How to stay valuable in an AI-shaped future\n\n\n\n(36:25) - Does vibe coding feel as satisfying?\n\n\n\n(39:47) - Is the web heading somewhere dark?\n\n\n\n(42:02) - Cursor wars, animations, and UX pet peeves\n\n\n\n(48:48) - Will GitHub projects go full Vibe Kanban in 2026?\n\n\n\n(54:41) - Holiday reflections and unplugging\n\n\n\n(58:18) - Staying up late and old routines\n\n\n\n(01:00:00) - Remembering Robbie’s dog\n\n\n\n(01:00:58) - 2026 plans, goals, and resolutions\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Forester: https://www.oldforester.com/\n\n\n\nShopify: https://www.shopify.com/\n\n\n\nMayday Parade: https://maydayparade.com/\n\n\n\nTeddy Swims: https://www.teddyswims.com/\n\n\n\nPost Malone: https://www.postmalone.com/\n\n\n\nJavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\n\n\n\nGrok: https://grok.com/\n\n\n\nAdam Wathan: https://x.com/adamwathan/\n\n\n\nTailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/\n\n\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/\n\n\n\nPrimeagen: https://x.com/ThePrimeagen\n\n\n\nGas Town: https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown\n\n\n\nRalph: https://github.com/snarktank/ralph\n\n\n\nClaude: https://claude.ai\n\n\n\nOpenCode: https://opencode.ai/\n\n\n\nMatt Pocock - Ship working code while you sleep with the Ralph Wiggum technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IK18goX4X8\n\n\n\nPython: https://www.python.org/\n\n\n\nOh-my-opencode: https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode\n\n\n\nBolt: https://bolt.new/\n\n\n\nWarp: https://www.warp.dev/\n\n\n\nChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/\n\n\n\nLovable: https://lovable.dev/\n\n\n\nSame: https://same.new/\n\n\n\nEmber: https://emberjs.com/\n\n\n\nExpedition 33: https://www.expedition33.com\n\n\n\nDestiny 2: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny\n\n\n\nAnything: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anything-ai-app-builder/id6751247034\n\n\n\nSwach: https://www.swach.io/\n\n\n\nElectron: https://www.electronjs.org/\n\n\n\nSwift: https://www.swift.org/\n\n\n\nCopilot: https://github.com/features/copilot\n\n\n\nThe Polar Express: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polar_Express_(film)\n\n\n\nReact Miami: https://www.reactmiami.com/\n\n\n\nRender ATL: https://www.renderatl.com/\n\n\n\nCascadiaJS: https://cascadiajs.com/\n\n\n\nAll Things Open: https://allthingsopen.org/\n\n\n\nCSS Day: https://cssday.nl/\n\nConnect with the hosts\n\n\n\n\n\nRobbie Wagner: https://x.com/RobbieTheWagner\n\n\n\nChuck Carpenter: https://x.com/CharlesWthe3rd\n\n\n\nAdam Argyle: https://x.com/argyleink\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://whiskey.fm\n\n\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whiskey-web-and-whatnot/id1552776603\n\n\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/19jiuHAqzeKnkleQUpZxDf\n\n\n\nOvercast: https://overcast.fm/itunes1552776603\n\n\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@WhiskeyWebAndWhatnot\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot Merch\nEnjoying the podcast and want us to make more?

Something about it all seems so patronizing to me. How can I approach this stuff with a different mindset?\nHello D & J! Quick one from your biggest fan!! This week (Tuesday 6th Jan 2k26) I was promoted to Tech Lead of our team. In my new role, I have done no work *cries*, I’ve spent all my time assisting team members, unblocking QA, dealing with ad hoc requests from product/stakeholders…. I asked the previous tech lead is this what they did? They did! And they said spent their personal time to complete stories assigned to them.\nIs this really what a tech lead does?!?!! Helpppp",

Hot takes include light mode vs dark mode SaaS, shifting developer aesthetics, and why AI productivity for developers may now come down to workflow design rather than raw coding skill.\nResources\nTailwind Layoffs and AI\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/tailwind-engineer-layoffs-ai-github-2026-1#:~:text=Tailwind%20laid%20off%2075%25%20of,on%20our%20engineering%20team%20lost\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957\nhttps://x.com/rough__sea/status/2013280952370573666\nhttps://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017\nAstro joins Cloudflare\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/astro-joins-cloudflare\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us?
