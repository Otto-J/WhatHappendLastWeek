Tom shares his journey from building a podcast app during the pandemic to working in developer relations at CloudMosa. They dive into digital minimalism, the surprisingly advanced features of today’s flip phones, and what it’s like to work remotely while traveling the globe.\nIn this episode:\n\n(00:00) - Intro\n(01:07) - Meet Tom Barrasso\n(02:54) - Whiskey rating & review: Johnny Walker Black\n(12:07) - Hot Take: Tailwind or vanilla CSS\n(12:26) - Hot Take: Fit rebase or merge?\n(13:13) - Hot Take: VS Code sidebar left or right?\n(13:33) - Hot Take: Were smartphones a mistake?\n(16:04) - Is switching to a flip phone easier today?\n(21:17) - Increasingly expensive fast food\n(22:58) - A brief history of flip phones\n(29:13) - Building for devices the modern web forgot\n(34:17) - How AI fits into developing for feature phones\n(39:28) - Language quirks, accents, and phonetic texting\n(42:34) - Tips for digital nomads and Tom’s global travels\n(50:15) - Workplace politics\n(55:21) - What would Tom do if not in tech?\n(59:04) - Plugs\n\nLinks\n\nJohnnie Walker Black: https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-us/our-whisky/core-range/johnnie-walker-black-label\nCloudMosa: https://www.cloudmosa.com/\nCloud Phone: https://www.cloudphone.tech/\nOpera Mini: https://www.opera.com/mini\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/\nXiamoi: https://www.mi.com/\nJack Daniel's: https://www.jackdaniels.com/\nTennessee Honey: https://www.jackdaniels.com/whiskey/tennessee-honey\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst: https://www.umass.edu/\nMacallan: https://www.themacallan.com/\nTailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/\nGit: https://github.com/GIT\nGitHub: https://github.com/\nC++: https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/\nVS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/\nNokia: https://www.nokia.com/\nAirPods: https://www.apple.com/airpods/\nUber: https://www.uber.com/\nChipotle: https://www.chipotle.com/\nTaco Bell: https://www.tacobell.com/\nMcDonald's: https://www.mcdonalds.com/\nMotorola Razr: https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/razr\nMicrosoft: https://www.microsoft.com/\nJava: https://www.java.com/\nVerizon: https://www.verizon.com/\nT-Mobile: https://www.t-mobile.com/\nBlackberry: https://www.blackberry.com/\nGoogle: https://www.google.com/\nFirefox: https://www.firefox.com/\nKaiOS: https://www.kaiostech.com/\nGeophone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophone\nVercel: https://vercel.com/\nJoe Rogan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan\nBoostrap: https://getbootstrap.com/\nSmashing Magazine: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/\nApple Watch: https://www.apple.com/watch/\nJavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\nKindle: https://amazon.com/kindle\nES3: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp\nEmber: https://emberjs.com/\nKaiOS.dev: https://kaios.dev/\nTypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\nClaude: https://claude.ai/\nDocker: https://www.docker.com/\nAngular: https://angular.dev/\nReact: https://react.dev/\nChuck E.

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI’m a senior developer on a small team, and I’m feeling frustrated with a junior developer I work with. They’re smart and perfectly capable, but they stick very strictly to the confines of their assigned work. They’ll finish their tickets, but unless they’re directly asked, they don’t offer to help with other areas, pitch in on shared responsibilities, or step up when the team is trying to work cross functionally.\nThis engineer seems content to stay in their lane and do “just enough.” I know they’re junior, so I don’t expect miracles, but I expect some initiative. This is most frustrating because it’s a small team and it often feels like we’re working with half of an engineer when they disappear into a corner and leave the pressing issues for the senior developers to handle.\nHow can I encourage them (or maybe push them a bit) to see the bigger picture and contribute more to the team’s success without coming across as bossy or micromanaging? Is this really my responsibility to fix, and am I expecting too much of a junior?\nI had my first day yesterday as a senior developer and dozed off at an hour meeting at the end of the day today. The meeting was about planning the next year on a zoom call with the leadership I was following in the beginning but at some point they started to talk in something I can‘t really understand(to excuse myself, I had had mant meetings throughout the day and still new to their product). I should’ve turned off my camera but I kept it on while I was definitely zoning out and got my eyes closed few times.\nI am so embarrassed and don’t know what should I do and feel. I like this new workplace and people so far but should I already look for another job? Help!!!",

That’s exactly what our guest Dimitri Mitropoulos did—and in this episode, we dive deep into the how, the why, and the mind-bending implications of this ambitious project. From type-level programming to the philosophical limits of Turing completeness, this is an episode that pushes the boundaries of what you thought was possible in JavaScript.\nWe talk about how the TypeScript type system evolved to become Turing-complete, how Dimitri pulled off this seemingly impossible feat, and why “Doom-complete” might just be the new gold standard for computational capability. Along the way, we touch on functional programming, generics, recursion, and even some Lambda Calculus. It’s part computer science theory, part coding madness, and 100% geeky goodness.\nEpisode Highlights\n[3:05] – Dimitri explains how a simple thought experiment turned into a year-and-a-half-long obsession\n[8:40] – The origins and significance of Turing completeness in type systems\n[14:15] – Why running Doom in TypeScript is more about proving limits than just showing off\n[19:55] – What it means to run programs inside the type system vs. TypeScript code itself\n[27:10] – ASCII art as output, functional recursion for game state, and hover-over frames in your editor\n[35:30] – How ignorance, determination, and obsession fueled the completion of the project\n[45:20] – Personal insights: balancing family, burnout, and passion while chasing an impossible dream\nLinks & Resources\nDimitri Mitropoulos\nMichigan TypeScript YouTube Channel – Dimitri's channel featuring the project\nType Challenges by Anthony Fu – Advanced TypeScript exercises\nSquiggleConf – The TypeScript-focused conference Dimitri co-founded\nJosh Goldberg – TypeScript expert and co-organizer of SquiggleConf\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
