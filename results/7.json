          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI’m a new listener to the podcast and work as the sole developer for a sports team, which is the only company I’ve worked for since graduating from university 8 years ago. I listened to episode 493 while clenching my teeth as you told a listener to absolutely not take the job with the European football club as a solo developer. Yikes! While I feel I have continued to grow my skillset in my role, I’m now feeling vulnerable about having no professional experience working alongside other developers or on large-scale applications.\nI feel very conflicted about leaving my current company. I have a respectable developer salary for the (non-American) low cost of living area I’m in, have a great manager, and have built up a ton of good will and trust within the organization. I get all the freedom I could ask for to make design decisions, implement devops practices, try out new technologies, and make mistakes. I also find the work interesting and there’s always something else to do! I’m a little scared of the horror stories that I hear about the real dev world and don’t want to take my current situation for granted.\nI would really appreciate guidance on what you think I should do. I have clear skill deficits in certain areas, but would have to give up a lot of liberties with a role change.\nListener Brian asks,\nMy job is mostly okay, but could be better because of the people in it. I joined a greenfield project a few years ago as my first software engineer role after transitioning from other data work. I grew up with the project and improved my engineering skills. A year ago we hired two new people. They had relevant experience and seemed to know what they were talking about in the interview, and had five & ten years of experience (aka, more than me).\nOnboarding the first few months was whatever, BUT they’ve never really improved afterwards. They turn in work that has clearly not been tested or does not meet the ticket’s requirements, barely review PRs and have never (!) left any comments/feedback, and despite their level (senior+). I don’t really trust them to work on anything more than the smallest, simplest stories.\nI’ve provided specific feedback in PRs and in performance reviews (sometimes very low-level and specific, and sometimes very high-level about guiding questions or principles), but nothing’s changed. I’ve felt frustrated, drained, and confused - why is it such a struggle to get someone with an entire decade of development experience to turn in a straightforward PR? One other teammate has admitted (privately) that some work was sloppily done, which is consoling but otherwise I’m not sure if it’s bothering others as much as it does me.\nThey’re offshore so maybe it’s just a communication thing? The rest of the team has been on the project since the beginning so maybe we’re poorly set up for new devs. I have high standards for myself and others and I’ve always been the most junior developer on the team and am new to the senior role.\nAm I just being a perfectionistic jerk? Is that a bad match for (essentially) junior teammates? Should I just reset my expectations and accept that their level and years of experience don’t translate into high performance? Thanks for any insights.",

          "showNotes": "Malicious code is making its way into VS Code extensions this week, as two Chinese-based AI coding assistants are identified as capturing every file on a user’s computer and sending it to servers in China without their knowledge or consent. Please just be cautious about what you’re installing on your machines, folks.\nIn related news, the Deno team has introduced Deno sandboxes to create and deploy secure, isolated VMs in the cloud. Strict permissions, network policies, directories, and isolated secrets—make these sandboxes great for AI agents, or any other dynamic workload where speed and security are paramount.\nAnd the software going viral this week is OpenClaw (aka Clawdbot aka Moltbot), which is an open source, autonomous AI agent that runs locally on a user’s machine. OpenClaw can connect to LLMs and perform tasks like managing emails, scheduling, reorganizing local files or other daily tasks, and is designed to be proactive rather than just reacting to prompts. It’s truly the Wild West giving an AI agent access to read all the files on a machine or respond to emails on its own, so be careful out there, folks.\nTimestamps:\n\n1:07 - VS Code AI plugins are stealing data\n10:47 - Deno sandboxes\n16:09 - OpenClaw\n43:41 - More Gemini features are coming to Chrome\n45:33 - Apple containers\n46:44 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - VS Code AI plugins are stealing all the data of users computers (silently)\nJack - Deno sandboxes\nTJ - OpenClaw (aka Clawdbot aka Moltbot) and our lack of trust for AI agents\n\nLightning News: \n\nMore Gemini features are coming to Chrome\nApple Containers\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Claude Code\nJack - Sneakers movie\nTJ - Firefox browser\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

          "showNotes": "Kev and Jeppe, discuss the cold weather in Denmark and Sweden compared to Hawaii. They highlight that \"Svelte Radio\" has ranked number 13 (effectively number 12) in the podcast section of the State of JS 2025 survey, placing them among the \"mainstream\" podcasts and slightly increasing the pressure to produce relevant content.\nState of JS: Frameworks\nThe hosts analyze the survey results for JavaScript frameworks:\n\nSvelte: Usage increased slightly to 27% (up from 26%). It maintains the highest interest rating for the sixth consecutive year, though interest is slightly declining—a trend seen across most frameworks. Satisfaction remains high at number two (86%), just behind Solid.\nReact: Continues to dominate with 70 million weekly downloads, but interest and satisfaction are declining. The hosts discuss the complexity of React Server Components (RSC) and the risks of framework developers losing touch with practical usage (\"dogfooding\").\nSolid: Rising in interest and taking the number one spot for satisfaction.\nHTMX: Saw a significant drop in interest, described as a \"meme\" that has cooled down.\nWeb Components: Chatter is growing (e.g., Lit), but usage remains relatively low compared to the push from DevRel teams.\n\nState of JS: Meta-Frameworks\n\nNext.js: Leads usage significantly at 59% but has low satisfaction, barely beating out Gatsby.\nAstro: Growing rapidly (27% usage) and ranked number one in satisfaction. Its strength lies in supporting multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte).\nSvelteKit: Ranked number two in satisfaction. Interest is declining, likely due to the framework maturing.\nTanStack Start: Noted as a popular write-in option and a strong new alternative to Next.js.\nAnalog: Mentioned as an Angular meta-framework powered by Vite.\n\nLibraries & Developer Tools\n\nThe hosts discuss various libraries and tools featured in the survey:\nValidation: Zod is the most used, but Valibot is recommended as a smaller, tree-shakable alternative. Both libraries support the new \"Standard Schema\" initiative.\nLinting: Oxlint is highlighted as a much faster, Rust-based alternative to ESLint.\nPackage Management: The tool ni is recommended for running package manager commands (install, run scripts) agnostically without needing to remember if a project uses npm, yarn, or pnpm.\nDate Libraries: Day.js, date-fns, and Luxon remain popular. The hosts anticipate the upcoming JavaScript Temporal API may eventually replace these.\njQuery: A new version was released that drops Internet Explorer 11 support and migrates to ES modules.\n\nPicks & Actionable Items\nThe hosts conclude with their picks for the week:\n\nKev's Pick: The TV show \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" (Game of Thrones universe).\nJeppes's Pick: npmx.dev, a modern, interactive interface for the NPM registry that includes vulnerability alerts and dependency graphs.\n\nActionable Items:\n\nTry ni: Use the ni CLI tool to handle package manager commands automatically across different projects.\nContribute to npmx.dev: The project is looking for contributors. It is described as a friendly community for those wanting to get into open source.\nAvoid AI Spam PRs: If contributing to npmx.dev or other projects, ensure contributions are genuine and not low-effort, AI-generated pull requests.",

          "showNotes": "Russ Miles joins the show to unpack why developer platforms fail and how to rethink platform engineering through the lens of flow of value rather than factory-style developer productivity metaphors.\nRuss explains why every organization already has an internal developer platform, and why treating it as platform as a product changes everything. The conversation explores cognitive load and cognitive burden, how to design around strong feedback loops, and why the OODA loop mindset helps teams make better decisions closer to development time.\nThey discuss the risks of overloading pipelines and CI/CD systems, the tension between shipping fast and handling security vulnerabilities in a regulated environment, and how to “shift left” without simply dumping responsibility onto developers. Drawing on lessons from Rod Johnson, the Spring Framework, TDD, and modern software engineering as described by Dave Farley, Russ reframes platforms as systems that support experimentation through the scientific method.\nThe episode also touches on AI assisted coding, developer focus, and how thoughtful developer experience and DX surveys can prevent burnout while improving value delivery.\nLinks\nWebsite: https://www.russmiles.com\nhttps://russmiles.substack.com\nhttps://x.com/russmiles\nResources\nTalk: https://www.russmiles.com/platform-engineering-failure-keynote\nhttps://russmiles.substack.com/p/developer-platform-devrel-listen\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us?

We dug into what actually happens when you run Node at scale, especially with server-side rendering, Kubernetes, and modern frameworks like Next.js.\nWe also challenged some popular assumptions—like whether newer runtimes automatically mean better performance—and explored how benchmarking, flame graphs, and smarter scheduling can completely change the reliability of production systems. If you’re running Node in Kubernetes, doing SSR, or trying to squeeze more performance out of your backend, this episode will definitely make you rethink your stack.\nLinks & Resources\nPlatformatic – https://platformatic.dev\nWatt Application Server (WattPM) – https://www.npmjs.com/package/wattpm\nNode.js Core Web Vitals (CrUX Dataset) – https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\nMatteo Collina on X (Twitter) – https://twitter.com/matteocollina\nNodeLand Newsletter – https://nodeland.dev\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
