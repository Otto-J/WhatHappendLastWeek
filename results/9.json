          "showNotes": "This week, Robbie and Adam sip High ‘n Wicked Straight Rye and dive deep into the current state of AI development tools, the rise of agentic workflows, and whether humans are becoming legacy dependencies in their own systems. They explore OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot), the philosophy behind Pi's minimalist agent approach, malleable software, and why SaaS products might be in trouble. Along the way, they debate meme coins, polymarket betting, the death of software-as-a-service, and what happens when AI agents start talking to each other on social media.\n\nIn this episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n(00:00) - Intro\n\n\n\n(01:43) - Whiskey rating & review: High ‘n Wicked Straight Rye\n\n\n\n(09:15) - Why proprietary limestone water matters (apparently)\n\n\n\n(11:55) - Tariffs, empty liquor store shelves, and Canadian boycotts\n\n\n\n(18:55) - Setting up OpenClaw and why it's better than you think\n\n\n\n(20:58) - Pi's minimalist philosophy: bash over MCP\n\n\n\n(26:51) - GitHub Agents and making PRs while brewing coffee\n\n\n\n(29:02) - Why AI feels like a drug (and not in a good way)\n\n\n\n(31:26) - Are we doing more work or just different work?\n\n\n\n(35:15) - MoltBook: when AI agents talk to each other\n\n\n\n(37:22) - RentAHuman.ai and the gig economy's weird future\n\n\n\n(40:58) - Polymarket, meme coins, and betting on everything\n\n\n\n(42:48) - Why SaaS products are tanking in the stock market\n\n\n\n(46:45) - Malleable software and the death of dark mode wait times\n\n\n\n(48:50) - Jim Beam layoffs and the whiskey surplus problem\n\n\n\n(52:57) - Electric cars, repair shops, and the end of tinkering\n\n\n\n(54:46) - Are we headed toward a black box future?\n\n\n\n(57:12) - CascadiaJS, React Miami, and Render ATL\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh ‘n Wicked Straight Rye: https://highandwicked.com/\n\n\n\nOpenClaw: https://github.com/cncf/openclaw\n\n\n\nPi: https://pi.ai/\n\n\n\nRailway: https://railway.app/\n\n\n\nGitHub Agents: https://github.com/features/agents\n\n\n\nClaude: https://claude.ai/\n\n\n\nAnthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/\n\n\n\nOpenAI: https://openai.com/\n\n\n\nQwen: https://qwenlm.github.io/\n\n\n\nMoltBook: https://www.moltbook.com/\n\n\n\nRentAHuman.ai: https://rentahuman.ai/\n\n\n\nPolymarket: https://polymarket.com/\n\n\n\nUber: https://www.uber.com/\n\n\n\nUber Eats: https://www.ubereats.com/\n\n\n\nTheo - t3.gg: https://t3.gg/\n\n\n\nMeticulous: https://meticulous.ai/\n\n\n\nTesla Model X: https://www.tesla.com/modelx\n\n\n\nJim Beam: https://www.jimbeam.com/\n\n\n\nCascadiaJS: https://cascadiajs.com/\n\n\n\nRender ATL: https://www.renderatl.com/\n\n\n\nReact Miami: https://www.reactmiami.com/\n\n\n\nAstro: https://astro.build/\n\n\n\nWarp: https://www.warp.dev/\n\nConnect with the hosts\n\n\n\n\n\nRobbie Wagner: https://x.com/RobbieWagner\n\n\n\nChuck Carpenter: https://x.com/chuckcarpenter\n\n\n\nAdam Argyle: https://x.com/argyleink\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://whiskey.fm\n\n\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whiskey-web-and-whatnot/id1552776603\n\n\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/19jiuHAqzeKnkleQUpZxDf\n\n\n\nOvercast: https://overcast.fm/itunes1552776603\n\n\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@WhiskeyWebAndWhatnot\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot Merch\nEnjoying the podcast and want us to make more?

Now that vibecoding is a thing, our CEO has kind of gone rogue, and and he’s vibecoding a bunch of random stuff, one of which he bought a domain for and has pushed a potential customer to pay for, without talking to our team. I feel like this is fragmenting our focus, but I don’t want to ban our CEO from vibecoding and being creative. how should I handle this without damaging relationships?\nAdmiralFox asks,\nHi Dave and Jamison!\nLongtime listener, first-time question asker here.\nAfter 14 years at a consultancy firm, I’m moving to a major retailer to become their Java Learning and Community Lead. Instead of shipping code, my new role will be shipping knowledge. I will be managing learning paths, organizing internal knowledge sharing events, and help managers screen candidates. Basically, I’m moving from a ‘Maker’ role to a ‘Multiplier’ role.\nI have 13 weeks of notice period (Standard European “I’m not leaving yet after 14 years” protocol) and I want to use my free evenings to prepare.\nMy questions for you:\nHow do I transition from “the guy with the technical answers” to “the guy who helps everyone else find the answers”?\nHow can I use the remaining time of my notice period to prepare for the people side of this role?\nLove the show! Keep up the ‘quit-your-job’ advice coming (although I’ve already taken it!)",

Thank you, listeners!\nGoogle has a new proposal called WebMCP, which is a way to define structured tools for agents visiting a site, ensuring they can perform actions with increased speed, reliability, and precision.\nAnd instead of complicated build processes to convert HTML to markdown for AI agents’ benefit, Cloudflare now offers real-time content conversion when AI systems request pages from any Cloudflare site.

Paige, Paul, Jack and Noel dig into the biggest stories reshaping the web development landscape right now.\nFrom there, the conversation shifts to the browser's changing role in the web, how the lines between native and web experiences continue to blur, and what that means for developers building for the future. The panel also tackles growing pressures on open source sustainability and the widening gap between developers who are deeply integrating AI agents into their workflows and everyone else who hasn't even heard of these tools yet.\nResources\nTechCrunch: OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI: https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joins-openai\nhttps://web.dev/blog/interop-2026\nhttps://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/chrome/gemini-3-auto-browse/\nhttps://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/what-to-expect-for-open-source-in-2026/?ref=thecodebrew.net\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us?

          "showNotes": "This week on JavaScript Jabber, we’re joined (again!) by Val Karpov — the maintainer of Mongoose — to talk about what’s new in Mongoose 9, how async stack traces are changing the debugging game, and why AI is quietly reshaping the way we build developer tools.\nWe dig into stricter TypeScript support, the removal of callback-based middleware, and what it really takes to modernize a massive codebase. Then we shift gears into Mongoose Studio, a schema-aware, AI-enhanced MongoDB GUI that brings streaming query results, map visualizations, and even LLM-powered document generation into your workflow. If you’ve ever wrestled with debugging database issues or squinting at raw JSON, this episode will get your wheels turning.\nWe also explore Cassandra integration, vector search, Bun vs. Deno, and what AI means for the future of software engineering. There’s a lot here — especially if you’re working in Node.js, MongoDB, or building backend-heavy JavaScript apps.\n🔗 Links & Resources\nMongoose – https://mongoosejs.com\nMongoose Studio – https://mongooseStudio.app\nElysiaJS – https://elysiajs.com\nTodoist – https://todoist.com\nKent C.
