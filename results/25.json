          "showNotes": "The Quirks And Gotchas of PHP\nIf you come from a JavaScript background, you'll likely be familiar with some of its famous quirks, such as 1 + \"1\" equaling \"11\". Well, PHP has its own set of quirks and gotchas, too. Some are oddly similar to JavaScript's, while others can surprise a JavaScript developer.\nLet's start with the more familiar ones.\n1. Type Juggling and Loose Comparisons\nLike JavaScript, PHP has two types of comparison operators: strict and loose. The loose comparison operator in PHP uses ==, while the strict comparison operator uses ===.\nHere's an example of a loose vs. strict comparison in PHP:\nvar_dump(1 == \"1\"); // true\nvar_dump(1 === \"1\"); // false\n\nPHP is a loosely typed language, meaning it will automatically convert variables from one type to another when necessary, just like JavaScript. This is not only when doing comparisons but also, for example, when doing numeric operations. Such conversions can lead to some unexpected results if you're not careful:\nvar_dump(1 + \"1\"); // int(2)\nvar_dump(1 + \"1.5\"); // float(2.5)\nvar_dump(1 + \"foo\"); // int(1) in PHP 7, TypeError in PHP 8\n\nAs you can see, the type system has gotten a bit stricter in PHP 8, so it won't let you commit some of the \"atrocities\" that were possible in earlier versions, throwing a TypeError instead. PHP 8 introduced many changes that aim to eliminate some of the unpredictable behavior; we will cover some of them throughout this article.\n1.1. Truthiness of Strings\nThis is such a common gotcha in PHP that it deserves its own heading. By default, PHP considers an empty string as false and a non-empty string as true:\nif (\"0\") {\n    // This block executes because \"0\" is a non-empty string\n    echo \"This is considered TRUE in PHP\";\n}\n\nBut wait, there's more! PHP also considers the string \"0\" as false:\nif (\"0\" == false) {\n    // This block executes because \"0\" is considered FALSE in PHP\n    echo \"This is considered FALSE in PHP\";\n}\n\nYou might think we're done here, but no! Try comparing a string such as \"php\" to 0:\nif (\"php\" == 0) {\n    // This block executes in PHP 7\n    echo \"This is considered TRUE in PHP 7\";\n}\n\nUntil PHP7, any non-numeric string was converted to 0 when cast to an integer to compare it to the other integer. That's why this example will be evaluated as true. This quirk has been fixed in PHP 8.\nFor a comprehensive comparison table of PHP's truthiness, check out the PHP documentation.\n1.2. Switch Statements\nSwitch statements in PHP use loose comparisons, so don't be surprised if you see some unexpected behavior when using them:\n$value = \"foo\";\nswitch ($value) {\n    case 0:\n        echo \"Value was 0\"; // This block executes\n        break;\n    case \"foo\":\n        echo \"Value was foo\";\n        break;\n}\n\nThe New Match Expression in PHP 8\nPHP 8 introduced the match expression, which is similar to switch but uses strict comparisons (i.e., === under the hood) and returns a value:\n$result = match ($value) {\n    0 => 'Value is zero',\n    1 => 'Value is one',\n    default => 'Something else',\n};\n\nUnlike switch, there is no \"fall-through\" behavior in match, and each branch must return a value, making match a great alternative when you need a more precise or concise form of branching—especially if you want to avoid the loose comparisons of a traditional switch.\n1.3 String to Number Conversion\nIn earlier versions of PHP, string-to-number conversions were often done silently, even if the string wasn’t strictly numeric (like '123abc'). In PHP 7, this would typically result in 123 plus a Notice:\n// In PHP 7:\nvar_dump(\"123abc\" + 0);\n// int(123), with a Notice\n\nIn PHP 8, you’ll still get int(123), but now with a Warning, and in other scenarios (like extremely malformed strings), you might see a TypeError. This stricter behavior can reveal hidden bugs in code that relied on implicit type juggling.\nStricter Type Checks & Warnings in PHP 8\nPerforming arithmetic on non-numeric strings:\nAs noted, in older versions, something like \"123abc\" + 0 would silently drop the non-numeric part, often producing 123 plus a PHP Notice. In PHP 8, such operations throw a more visible Warning or TypeError, depending on the exact scenario.\nNull to Non-Nullable Internal Arguments:\nPassing null to a function parameter that’s internally declared as non-nullable will trigger a TypeError in PHP 8. Previously, this might have been silently accepted or triggered only a warning.\nInternal Function Parameter Names:\nPHP 8 introduced named arguments but also made internal parameter names part of the public API. If you use named arguments with built-in functions, be aware that renaming or reordering parameters in future releases might break your code. Always match official parameter names as documented in the PHP manual.\nUnion Types & Mixed\nSince PHP 8.0, we can declare union types, which allows you to specify that a parameter or return value can be one of multiple types. For example:\nfunction getUser(int|string $id) {\n// ...\n}\n\nSpecifying the union of types your function accepts can help clarify your code’s intent and reveal incompatibilities if your existing code relies on looser type checking, preventing some of the conversion quirks we’ve discussed.\n2. Operator Precedence and Associativity\nOperator precedence can lead to confusing situations if you’re not careful with parentheses. For instance, the . operator (string concatenation similar to + in JavaScript) has left-to-right associativity, but certain logical operators have lower precedence than assignment or concatenation, leading to puzzling results in PHP 7 and earlier:\necho \"Sum: \" . 1 + 2;\n// Actually interpreted as ((echo \"Sum: \") . 1) + 2\n// Outputs `2` and a Warning: A non-numeric value encountered\n\necho \"Sum: \" . (1 + 2);\n// Correctly prints \"Sum: 3\"\n\nPHP 8 has fixed this issue by making the + and - operators take a higher precedence.\n3. Variable Variables and Variable Functions\nNow, we're getting into unfamiliar territory as JavaScript Developers. PHP allows you to define variable variables and variable functions. This can be a powerful feature, but it can also lead to some confusing code:\n$varName = 'hello';\n$$varName = 'world';\n\necho $hello; // Outputs 'world'\n\nIn this example, the variable $varName contains the string 'hello'. By using $$varName, we're creating a new variable with the name 'hello' and assigning it the value 'world'.\nSimilarly, you can create variable functions:\nfunction greet() {\n    echo \"Hello!\";\n}\n\n$func = 'greet';\n$func(); // Calls greet()\n\n4. Passing Variables by Reference\nYou can pass variables by reference using the & operator in PHP. This means that any changes made to the variable inside the function will be reflected outside the function:\nfunction increment(&$num) {\n    $num++;\n}\n\n$number = 5;\nincrement($number);\necho $number; // Outputs 6\n\nWhile this example is straightforward, not knowing the pass-by-reference feature can lead to some confusion, and bugs can arise when you inadvertently pass variables by reference.\n5. Array Handling\nPHP arrays are a bit different from JavaScript arrays. They can be used as both arrays and dictionaries, and they have some quirks that can catch you off guard. For example, if you try to access an element that doesn't exist in an array, PHP will return null instead of throwing an error:\n$arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar_dump($arr[3]); // NULL\n\nFurthermore, PHP arrays can contain both numerical and string keys at the same time, but numeric string keys can sometimes convert to integers, depending on the context>\n$array = [\n    \"1\"   => \"One (as string)\",\n    1     => \"One (as int)\",\n    true  => \"True as key?\"\n];\n\nvar_dump($array);\n// Output can be surprising:\n// array(1) {\n//   [1] => string(12) \"True as key?\"\n// }\n\nIn this example:\n\"1\" (string) and 1 (integer) collide, resulting in the array effectively having only one key: 1.\ntrue is also cast to 1 as an integer, so it overwrites the same key.\nAnd last, but not least, let's go back to the topic of passing variables by reference. You can assign an array element by reference, which can feel quite unintuitive:\n$array = ['apple', 'banana'];\n$fruit = &$array[0];  // $fruit is now referencing the first element\n$fruit = 'pear';\n\nvar_dump($array);\n// array(2) {\n//   [0] => \"pear\",\n//   [1] => \"banana\"\n// }\n\n6 Checking for Variable Truthiness (isset, empty, and nullsafe operator)\nIn PHP, you can use the empty() function to check if a variable is empty. But what does \"empty\" mean in PHP? The mental model of what's considered \"empty\" in PHP might differ from what you're used to in JavaScript. Let's clarify this:\nThe following values are considered empty by the empty() function:\n\"\" (an empty string)\n0 (0 as an integer)\n0.0 (0 as a float)\n\"0\" (0 as a string)\nnull\nfalse\n[] (an empty array)\nThis means that the following values are not considered empty:\n\"0\" (a string containing \"0\")\n\" \" (a string containing a space)\n0.0 (0 as a float)\nnew stdClass() (an empty object)\nKeep this in mind when using empty() in your code, otherwise, you might end up debugging some unexpected behavior.\nUndefined Variables and isset()\nAnother little gotcha is that you might expect empty() to return true for undefined variables too - they contain nothing after all, right? Unfortunately, empty() will throw a notice in such case. To account for undefined variables, you may want to use the isset() function, which checks if a variable is set and not null:\n$var = 0;\nif (isset($var) && !empty($var)) {\n    echo \"Variable is set and not empty\";\n}\n\nThe Nullsafe Operator\nIf you have a chain of properties or methods that you want to access, you may tend to check each step with isset() to avoid errors:\nif (isset($object) && isset($object->child)) {\n    echo $object->child->getName();\n}\n\nIn fact, because isset() is a special language construct and it doesn't fully evaluate an undefined part of the chain, it can be used to evaluate the whole chain at once:\nif (isset($object->child)) {\n    $result = $object->child->getName();\n}\n\nThat's much nicer! However, it could be even more elegant with the nullsafe operator (?->) introduced in PHP 8:\n// Instead of checking multiple times if $object or $object->child is null:\n$result = $object?->child?->getName();\n\nIf you’ve used optional chaining in JavaScript or other languages, this should look familiar. It returns null if any part of the chain is null, which is handy but can also hide potential logic mistakes — if your application logic expects objects to exist, silently returning null may lead to subtle bugs.\nConclusion\nWhile PHP shares a few loose typing quirks with JavaScript, it also has its own distinctive behaviors around type juggling, operator precedence, passing by reference, and array handling. Becoming familiar with these nuances — and with the newer, more predictable features in PHP 8 — will help you avoid subtle bugs and write clearer, more robust code. PHP continues to evolve, so always consult the official documentation to stay current on best practices and language changes.",

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nA listener named Mike says,\nTo what degree do you think it’s appropriate to talk with your peer managers about people that have moved from their team to yours? How much weight do you give their criticisms of an IC that they used to manage that is working out just fine under your leadership? How do you know if it was mostly due to a conflict in their relationship, or if there’s a nugget of truth you need to look out for?\nHi, thanks for a great show. I’ve listened to 400 episodes in a year - thanks for making my commute fun!\nI’ve been at my current job as a software developer for a year. It’s a great company overall, but we rely on a 30-year-old in-house ticket system that also doubles as a time reporting tool. It lacks many basic features, and project managers often resort to SQL and Excel just to get an overview. As you can imagine, things get forgotten and lost easily. Everyone dislikes it, but the old-timers are used to it.\nThey want any replacement to be cheap and also handle time reporting, which really limits our options. I suggested to keep using the old system for time reporting only for now, but the reaction made me feel like I’d suggested going back to pen and paper.\nWhile the company is old and set in its ways in some areas, it has made big changes in others, so I’m not ready to give up hope just yet. How can I at least nudge the company toward adopting a more modern ticket system to improve visibility and planning? I’ve shown examples that save time and offer better overviews, but it hasn’t made much impact. Where should I focus my efforts—or do I just have to learn to live with it?\nSome more context: This is in Europe and the culture at the company is generally open to feedback and discussions from anyone. I have 10+ years experience and a relatively good influence. My manager is driving change successfully to make the company more modern but I suspect he might have given up on this one.",
