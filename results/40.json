          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\n(follow-up from question 449)\nHello. Return question asker here. You answered my question from episode 449 “my tech lead ignored my warnings”. I want to give a follow up. I sat by and did not say anything else, he shipped the broken feature, and it broke in production. Instead of fixing it he rose the threshold on the datadog alert so high no one would ever get alerted. Then he left the company. When talking to my manager about the bug we agreed it was part of that refactor and I said “I warned him” and they shrugged it off.\nI assume he is also a long time listener of this podcast and took the age old “leave your job” advice. Kudos.\n(question below)\nI am here for more than just an update though. I am starting to think I understand why he left. It sucks here. I am the lowest level engineer on my team and have not been promoted for the last 2 years because “there is no money”. Ok, fine, I understand that the economy is tough. However I have increased the revenue of my department by 4x, have lead the development of our flagship product this entire year, have been teaching engineers new technology and have been working 60 hour weeks. On a team of 6 I do 33% of the work. 2x what is expected of any one engineer. This last week I received a “meets expectations” performance review. And I am mad. In 1-1’s with my boss they explicitly tell me “I am not saying to sandbag but just do less work. Your teammates are getting compared to you and its making everyone look bad.”\nDon’t worry Dave and Jamison, I am going to quit this job so I don’t need that advice, however you can throw it in if you like, but I’m wondering how do I handle this? Do I confront my manager in the next 1-1 with the data and say I am underleveled and underpaid or do I just take the advice to do less and coast til I find another job? Do I share with HR in the eventual exit interview that this was the straw that broke the camels back?\nI’m returning to work after a very long absence due to personal issues. How can I ramp back up quickly? It’s a weird situation because I’m not exactly joining a new job, but it’s been so long that it basically is. I haven’t even opened a code editor in months!",

          "showNotes": "In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Wes Eklund from AWS ProServe about interviews, practical AI, and the future of developer workflows. Wes shares what trips candidates up in coding and behavioral rounds, how to ask better questions, and why prepping multiple honest STAR narratives matters. Danny introduces the Thrive Framework for behavioral interviews and Rob underscores the discipline required to stand out in a crowded market. The trio then digs into 100 Days of Code in the AI era, smart ways juniors can learn with AI, and how Wes’s team uses MCP servers and Amazon Q to speed design, onboarding, and day-to-day delivery. They cover the lull in MCP hype, real security concerns, the “80 percent is a win” mindset when AI accelerates work, and when it actually makes sense to build agents. They close on thin, purpose-built agents, enterprise adoption patterns, and why frameworks like DSPy could reshape moats and costs.\n\n\nKey Takeaways from this episode:\n- Wes explains how candidates often fail because they neglect behavioral prep, and Danny introduces the Thrive Framework as a system to stand out.\n- The group debates whether juniors should use AI. Wes frames it as a tool for strategy and reflection, not a shortcut, while Danny emphasizes using it to deepen knowledge and accountability.\n- Wes shares how his AWS team leverages MCP servers and Amazon Q to speed design, boost onboarding, and solve problems faster, while Danny highlights enterprise-level use cases like multilingual documentation.\n- They discuss whether developers should build agents, the risks of security gaps, and how frameworks like DSPy could make optimized, lightweight agents a new competitive edge.\n\n\nChapters\n0:00 MCP servers: security reality check\n0:33 Modern Web Podcast intro\n0:55 Guest: Wes Ecklan (AWS ProServe)\n2:02 Job hunt & interview mistakes\n5:05 Danny’s THRIVE framework\n7:39 Researching values & STAR stories\n11:12 Sponsor + quality & discipline in applications\n13:04 100 Days of Code in the AI era\n18:03 Using AI at work (MCP + Amazon Q)\n23:13 Hackathons & making time to innovate\n25:06 MCPs in practice: adoption & security\n36:00 Agents: when they help vs. hype — close & links\n\n\nWes Eklund on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/weseklund/\nRob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/\nDanny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/\nThis Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabs\nThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMedia\nThis Dot Labs Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/\nThis Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/\nThis Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.social\n\n\nSponsored by This Dot Labs: https://ai.thisdot.co/",

Adam and Kevin also explain how advances like relative color syntax and app property are making CSS variables more dynamic and reliable.

Yoni, a consultant who’s worked with over 40 organizations to refine developer workflows, shares valuable lessons learned from helping teams design efficient and reliable tests.\nWe explore emerging trends in testing, including the rise of browser-based test runners, the shift from unit testing toward more integration and component testing, and how modern frameworks like Playwright, Vite Test Browser Mode, and Storybook are changing the way developers think about confidence in their code. We also tackle the role of AI in writing and maintaining tests, the pros and cons of mocking vs. real backends, and why contract testing is becoming essential in 2025.\nIf you’ve ever struggled with flaky end-to-end tests, wondered how to balance speed with confidence, or wanted a clear breakdown of modern testing tools, this conversation will give you practical insights and fresh perspectives to take back to your projects.\nLinks & Resources\nYoni Goldberg’s GitHub\nGoldbergYoni.com\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
