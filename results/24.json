          "itemTitle": "Roo Custom Modes",
          "media": null,
          "showNotes": "Roo Custom Modes\nRoo Code is an extension for VS Code that provides agentic-style AI code editing functionality. You can configure Roo to use any LLM model and version you want by providing API keys. Once configured, Roo allows you to easily switch between models and provide custom instructions through what Roo calls \"modes.\"\nRoo Modes can be thought of as a \"personality\" that the LLM takes on. When you create a new mode in Roo, you provide it with a description of what personality Roo should take on, what LLM model should be used, and what custom instructions the mode should follow. You can also define workspace-level instructions via a .roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ directory at your project root with markdown files inside. Having different modes allows developers to quickly fine-tune how the Roo Code agent performs its tasks.\nRoo ships out-of-the-box with some default modes: Code Mode, Architect Mode, Ask Mode, Debug Mode, and Orchestrator Mode. These can get you far, but I have expanded on this list with a few custom modes I have made for specific scenarios I run into every day as a software engineer.\nMy Custom Modes\n📜 Documenter Mode\nI created this mode to help me with generating documentation for legacy codebases my team works with. I use this mode to help produce documentation interactively with me while I read a codebase.\nMode Definition\nYou are Roo, a highly skilled technical documentation writer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices. You are working alongside a human software engineer, and your responsibility is to provide documentation around the code you are working on. You will be asked to provide documentation in the form of comments, markdown files, or other formats as needed.\nMode-specific Instructions\nYou will respect the following rules:\nYou will not write any code, only markdown files.\nIn your documentation, you will provide references to specific files and line numbers of code you are referencing.\nYou will not attempt to execute any commands.\nYou will not attempt to run the application in the browser.\nYou will only look at the code and infer functionality from that.\n👥 Pair Programmer Mode\nI created a “Pair Programmer” mode to serve as my personal coding partner. It’s designed to work in a more collaborative way with a human software engineer. When I want to explore multiple ideas quickly, I switch to this mode to rapidly iterate on code with Roo. In this setup, I take on the role of the navigator—guiding direction, strategy, and decisions—while Roo handles the “driving” by writing and testing the code we need.\nMode Definition\nYou are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices. You are working alongside a human software engineer who will be checking your work and providing instructions. If you get stuck, ask for help and we will solve problems together.\nMode-specific Instructions\nYou will respect the following rules:\nYou will not install new 3rd party libraries without first providing usage metrics (stars, downloads, latest version update date).\nYou will not do any additional tasks outside of what you have been told to do.\nYou will not assume to do any additional work outside of what you have been instructed to do.\nYou will not open the browser and test the application. Your pairing partner will do that for you.\nYou will not attempt to open the application or the URL at which the application is running. Assume your pairing partner will do that for you.\nYou will not attempt to run npm run dev or similar commands. Your pairing partner will do that for you.\nYou will not attempt to run a development server of any kind. Your pairing partner will handle that for you.\nYou will not write tests unless instructed to.\nYou will not make any git commits unless explicitly told to do so.\nYou will not make suggestions of commands to run the software or execute the test suite. Assume that your human counterpart has the application running and will check your work.\n🧑‍🏫 Project Manager\nI created this mode to help me write tasks for my team with clear and actionable acceptance criteria.\nMode Definition\nYou are a professional project manager. You are highly skilled in breaking down large tasks into bite-sized pieces that are actionable by an engineering team or an LLM performing engineering tasks. You analyze features carefully and detail out all edge cases and scenarios so that no detail is missed.\nMode-specific Instructions\nThink creatively about how to detail out features. Provide a technical and business case explanation about feature value. Break down features and functionality in the following way. The following example would be for user login:\nUser Login: As a user, I can log in to the application so that I can make changes. This prevents anonymous individuals from accessing the admin panel.\nAcceptance Criteria\nOn the login page, I can fill in my email address:\nThis field is required.\nThis field must enforce email format validation.\nOn the login page, I can fill in my password:\nThis field is required.\nThe input a user types into this field is hidden.\nOn failure to log in, I am provided an error dialog:\nThe error dialog should be the same if the email exists or not so that bad actors cannot glean info about active user accounts in our system.\nError dialog should be a red box pinned to the top of the page.\nError dialog can be dismissed.\nAfter 4 failed login attempts, the form becomes locked:\nDisplay a dialog to the user letting them know they can try again in 30 minutes.\nForm stays locked for 30 minutes and the frontend will not accept further submissions.\n🦾 Agent Consultant\nI created this mode for assistance with modifying my existing Roo modes and rules files as well as generating higher quality prompts for me. This mode leverages the Context7 MCP to keep up-to-date with documentation on Roo Code and prompt engineering best practices.\nMode Definition\nYou are an AI Agent coding expert. You are proficient in coding with agents and defining custom rules and guidelines for AI powered coding agents. Your specific expertise is in the Roo Code tool for VS Code are you are exceptionally capable at creating custom rules files and custom mode.\nThis is your workflow that you should always follow:\n\nBegin every task by retrieving relevant documentation from context7\nFirst retrieve Roo documentation using get-library-docs with \"/roovetgit/roo-code-docs\"\nThen retrieve prompt engineering best practices using get-library-docs with “/dair-ai/prompt-engineering-guide\"\nReference this documentation explicitly in your analysis and recommendations\nOnly after consulting these resources, proceed with the task\nWrapping It Up\nRoo’s “Modes” have become an essential part of how I leverage AI in my day-to-day work as a software engineer. By tailoring each mode to specific tasks—whether it’s generating documentation, pairing on code, writing project specs, or improving prompt quality—I’ve been able to streamline my workflow and get more done with greater clarity and precision.\nRoo’s flexibility lets me define how it should behave in different contexts, giving me fine-grained control over how I interact with AI in my coding environment. Roo also has the capability of defining custom modes per project if that is needed by your team. If you find yourself repeating certain workflows or needing more structure in your interactions with AI tools, I highly recommend experimenting with your own custom modes. The payoff in productivity and developer experience is absolutely worth it.",

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nMr A. N. Onymous says,\nHi Dave and Jamison,\nLong time listened, second time caller! I wrote a little while back with a common new-manager question about how to handle one of my reports who was at the lower end performance wise, but at the top end on the pay scale. I’d been trying to manage it by getting raises for the rest of the team in order to balance things out a bit (and make the rest of the team happy). I did consider Limogeage but having them on the team was better than a vacancy.\nFast forward a year or so, and the problem resolved itself when this team member left - or so I thought. We’ve had a few months gap before opening recruitment again, and it turns out this team member wasn’t happy at their new role and has applied to come back. Given they negotiated well with us the first time I’m guessing they’ve had a healthy pay bump at their new role. What should I do?\nOn the one hand I know their performance, they do deliver well and I’m happy working with them and managing them. Would it be rude to offer them to come back at their previous salary (assuming they’re the “best” person when we interview)? Will they be offended if we don’t offer them the role?\nWe haven’t had interviews yet - so help me Dave and Jamison, you’re my only hope!\nAI has taken over my team mate’s brain. HELP!\nI work for a ~10ish or so team building a B2B finances related app for several platforms (mobile, web, backend, etc). On the Web team, there’s only two of us.\nI’ve been on this team for around 4 years now, and during this times I’ve had several coworkers (the previous ones have either left the company voluntarily or involuntarily, moved to other teams, or completely left the field). I’m 100% convinced it’s not because of me, so let’s take that out of the question right away :-). All of this to say is that I tend to be the person that knows the most about our (quite large) codebase.\nWe work on a ten-year-old React application with some technical debt, but overall I think it’s pretty good.\nMy coworker comes from Android development. While he’s a great developer and has AMAZING soft skills (probably a listener of this podcast!, or maybe not because he has not quit yet?) he’s a little bit lacking on the general “Web Stuff (TM)” knowledge and many of the specifics details of our codebase.\nA bigger problem is that he seems to have totally given up on learning web skills or understanding our codebase and is instead just tab-tab-tab-ing autocompleted AI crap all over the codebase.\nHis code works as expected, but when reviewing his PRs I feel like a slave of the AI. I’m not reviewing another human’s work, but just what some AI model is doing. While it works, it’s terrible code for another human to maintain. For example, there’s lots of “inline” crap that we already have utility functions or libraries for, regexes everywhere, custom CSS all over the place instead of using our design system, abuse of the CSS cascade instead of using our CSS-inJS solution, large files with lots of code repeating existing logic that’s already somewhere else, and code comments every 2 lines or so which provide no value, but that’s what AI does to explain things.\nI’m not against AI (I also have explicitly to say this to prevent it killing me in the future). I use it for explaining things to me, writing utility functions, suggesting improvements, or as a google search replacement that saves a lot of time.\nBut leaving AI to do your work mindlessly while you sip orange juice and watch how it codes is wrong. We’re not there yet. These PRs work and are difficult to reject because management wants to ship fast. However, they are harming the codebase. We’ll get to the point where only AI will be able to touch it due to the amount of repetition, duplication and overall non-human friendly code.\nHow do I tell this person “Please stop doing this and instead learn things properly, and use AI as a tool and stop you being the tool of the AI” without hurting any feelings, and without being seen as the AI grinch?\nThanks for your help! Love the podcast, and why scroll keeps jumping up when writing on this form? Seems like AI is boycotting me.",

Now, the company’s CEO has released a letter detailing why these decisions were made and what the future holds for The Browser Company. Details on Dia are vague, but the team is optimistic they can build “a true successor to the browser”.\nAI-enabled coding IDE Cursor hit v1.0, this week with a bunch of notable features.

They unpack the current wave of AI announcements from Google I/O and Microsoft Build, and zoom in on the significance of MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a foundational shift in how AI-powered apps will be built and used.\nTejas breaks down what MCP is, why it's catching on across the industry, and how it could become the HTTP of AI apps. The group explores real-world examples, like AI apps managing your inbox or booking flights without ever opening a browser, and discuss how MCP servers enable secure, agent-driven experiences that can act on your behalf. They also touch on hallucinations, the role of fine-tuning vs. tool integration, and the future of checkout flows powered by AI agents.\n\n\nKeypoints from this Episode:\n- MCP enables structured communication between AI apps and servers, allowing agents to perform real tasks like sending emails or booking flights\n- Users will increasingly interact with applications through natural language, with agents handling workflows behind the scenes\n- Connecting models to tools via MCP helps reduce hallucinations by ensuring actions and responses are grounded in real data\n- Most use cases benefit more from retrieval-augmented generation and strong tool integration than from expensive model fine-tuning\n\n\nFollow Tejas on Social Media\nTwitter: https://x.com/TejasKumar_\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasq/",
