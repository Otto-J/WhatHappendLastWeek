          "showNotes": "Building a Next.js application connected to MongoDB can feel like a match made in heaven. MongoDB stores all of its data as JSON objects, which don’t require transformation into JavaScript objects like relational SQL data does. However, when deploying your application to a serverless production environment such as Vercel, it is crucial to manage your database connections properly.\nIf you encounter errors like these, you may be experiencing Connection Storming:\nMongoServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>\nMongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [<hostname>:<port>] on first connect\nMongoTimeoutError: Server selection timed out after <x> ms\nMongoTopologyClosedError: Topology is closed, please connect\nMongo Atlas: Connections % of configured limit has gone above 80\nConnection storming occurs when your application has to mount a connection to Mongo for every serverless function or API endpoint call. Vercel executes your application’s code in a highly concurrent and isolated fashion. So, if you create new database connections on each request, your app might quickly exceed the connection limit of your database. \nWe can leverage Vercel’s fluid compute model to keep our database connection objects warm across function invocations. Traditional serverless architecture was designed for quick, stateless web app transactions. Now, especially with the rise of LLM-oriented applications built with Next.js, interactions with applications are becoming more sequential. We just need to ensure that we assign our MongoDB connection to a global variable.\n\nProtip: Use global variables\nVercel’s fluid compute model means all memory, including global constants like a MongoDB client, stays initialized between requests as long as the instance remains active. By assigning your MongoDB client to a global constant, you avoid redundant setup work and reduce the overhead of cold starts. This enables a more efficient approach to reusing connections for your application’s MongoDB client.\nThe example below demonstrates how to retrieve an array of users from the users collection in MongoDB and either return them through an API request to /api/users or render them as an HTML list at the /users route. To support this, we initialize a global clientPromise variable that maintains the MongoDB connection across warm serverless executions, avoiding re-initialization on every request.\n// lib/mongodb.ts\nimport { MongoClient, Db } from 'mongodb';\n\nif (!process.env.MONGODB_URI) {\n  throw new Error('Invalid/Missing environment variable: \"MONGODB_URI\"');\n}\n\nconst clientPromise: Promise<MongoClient> = (async () => {\n  const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI!);\n  const connectedClient = await client.connect();\n  console.log('✅ MongoDB connection established');\n  return connectedClient;\n})();\n\nexport async function getDatabase(): Promise<Db> {\n  const client = await clientPromise;\n  return client.db('testing_db');\n}\n\nUsing this database connection in your API route code is easy:\n// src/app/api/users/route.ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport { getDatabase } from '@/lib/mongodb';\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const db = await getDatabase();\n  const collection = db.collection('users');\n  const users = await collection.find({}).toArray();\n  return NextResponse.json({ users });\n}\n\nYou can also use this database connection in your server-side rendered React components.\n// src/app/users/page.tsx\nimport { getDatabase } from '@/lib/mongodb'\n\nexport default async function UserList() {\n  const db = await getDatabase()\n  const collection = db.collection('users')\n  const users = await collection.find({}).toArray()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Users List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {users.map((user) => (\n          <li key={user._id.toString()}>{user.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nIn serverless environments like Vercel, managing database connections efficiently is key to avoiding connection storming. By reusing global variables and understanding the serverless execution model, you can ensure your Next.js app remains stable and performant.",

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHi Dave and Jamison,\nLong-time listener, first-time question asker. Thank you both for the wisdom, perspective, and jokes you bring to the podcast.\nI recently received an inheritance of around $500,000. It’s not “quit your job and buy a yacht” money, but it is enough to reshape my life. I’m in my late 30s, currently working in a senior engineering role. I’ve had a solid run in the world of code, but I’m ready to walk away from it, zero regrets, just done. What’s pulling me now is UX and product design: more creative, human-centered, systems-aware work.\nI’ve applied for a one year master’s program in UX design, starting in 2026. I’m planning a sabbatical before that to travel, reset, and explore - think trains across Canada, a design conference in Vienna, a food tour in Greece. I’m also investing in short courses and portfolio work during that time.\nFinancially, I’ve been careful: I paid off my mortgage, invested part of the inheritance, and set up a buffer. So I’m not winging it… but I am stepping away from a six-figure salary, a career my friends and family have supported me to build, and am will have no income for the next 18 months, and that’s a little scary. I want to use this opportunity well, not just coast, or panic-spend, or accidentally put myself in a worse position five years from now.\nHow would you approach this kind of mid-career pivot with a windfall cushion? Any mental models, risk assessments, or “soft skills” wisdom to help me stay brave and smart?\nThanks again for everything you put out into the world.\nHi Soft Skills Engineering Team,\nI’m the oldest person on my team (by a respectable margin), and I’ve been taking great delight in gently baffling my younger colleagues with expressions like “I’ll get that done in two ticks,” “give me a bell if you need help,” and “stay on the line after stand-up” (even though we’re on Teams, not a landline).\nIt has become a bit of a sport for me to see how many retro, obscure, or regionally-specific phrases I can sneak into our chats and meetings before someone finally asks, “What are you even saying?”\nMy question is:\nWhat other delightfully old-school and vaguely professional expressions can I deploy to maintain my status as the team’s resident linguistic cryptid?\nThanks for all the great advice you give, and for validating my mission to keep corporate life interesting!\nWarmest regards,\nResident Old Person",

          "showNotes": "The big tech company conferences continued this summer with Vercel hosting Vercel Ship 2025. As you’d expect there was lots of talk about AI and Vercel’s AI Cloud: tools, infrastructure, and platform enhancements to build AI agents and help AI agents use Vercel.\nOn July 1, hosting platform Cloudflare declared Content Independence Day, and changed its settings to block AI crawlers by default unless they pay creators for their content. While we absolutely support this move, Cloudflare’s future vision of a marketplace where content creators and AI companies come together and compensation is based on how much content “furthers knowledge” seems idealistic, but we’ll have to wait and see.\nServerless Postgres database company Neon has a new product called Neon Launchpad that can create an instant Neon database with zero configuration or account creation. Users get an automatically generated connection string, 72 hours to claim a new database, and even automatic database seeding with SQL scripts for schema and data initialization.\nTimestamps:\n\n2:13 - Vercel Ship event updates\n7:49 - Cloudfare declares content independence day\n16:12 - Neon Launchpad\n20:03 - Figma IPO\n22:24 - Deno v.
