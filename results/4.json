          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nListener Tom says,\nI’m a software developer with six years experience, mostly at small startups with engineering teams anywhere between 2 and 10 developers.\nBecause these startups have been small, most of the interviews were really casual. I’d speak to either the CEO, or CTO about my past experience, and we would talk about the direction the company was heading, and whether I’d be interested in joining. They felt less like interviews, and more like free-flowing conversations.\nI’m now back on the market, and I’m looking at larger, more established tech companies. I can get past the tech interviews just fine, but I’m struggling with the soft-skills interviews. Compared to what I’m used to they’re a lot more structured and it feels like they’re looking for answers that fit a certain criteria and format.\nWhat advice would you give to someone used to interviewing at small startups, but now interviewing at larger companies?\nI took an unpaid full stack internship role at a new non-profit, and it turned out to be a team completely made of other interns. There isn’t a single experienced engineer on the team. I have gone way deeper than originally intended and am now functionally a founding engineer where the founder pretends I’m a lead engineer and calls me an intern. The founder is also hellbent on having the highest development velocity, and sometimes will contribute their own AI-generated code, often bypassing the review process especially for things I’m not comfortable signing off on like an AI-generated TOS and user agreement.\nI recently learned that the founder is not viewed highly in their local area after a scandal where they were accused of scamming a large sum of money, which is likely why they are doing their free community projects they started now in order to save face. This has backfired, and now people are calling their projects “AI generated schemes” despite the services being completely free.\nI’m not sure if I should continue contributing to these projects anymore. Since the founder rushes things to get done, walks through legal areas with their AI “lawyer,” and has a bad image, I’m worried about whether my resume will be taken seriously by potential future employers.\nShould I continue working for this person or is the experience not worth it?",

          "showNotes": "A new year, a new tactic to stem the flow of npm supply chain attacks. This time, the proposal is for “Staged Publishing” which introduces a review window that a package owner must approve before a package release becomes publicly available.\nVercel Labs is out with a new AI tool called json-render that lets users generate dashboards, widgets, apps, and data visualizations from prompts, and constrains the response to JSON for only components pre-defined by the user.\nFinally, The Simpsons character Ralph Wiggum is the biggest thing in AI coding recently. Ralph is an AI development pattern using a while loop (like a bash script) to repeatedly run an AI agent on the same task, feeding its output back as context, and forcing it to iterate until a specific completion promise is met, rather than letting the AI stop prematurely. Interesting? Yes! Useful in practice? Still tbd.\nChapter Markers:\n\n1:04 - npm to implement staged publishing\n8:16 - Vercel’s json-render\n16:13 - Ralph Wiggum loops\n30:53 - Claude Code tips\n33:52 - Firefox 147 and anchor positioning\n35:42 - Fire starter\n39:40 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - npm to implement Staged Publishing\nJack - Vercel Labs’ json-render\nTJ - Ralph Wiggum loops\n\nLightning News: \n\nFirefox 147 and anchor positioning\n\nFire Starters:\n\nCSS @container scroll-state()\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Rolife Book Nook Garden House miniature\nJack - Blade Runner live at the symphony\nTJ - Coffee advent calendars\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.
