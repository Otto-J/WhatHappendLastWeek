          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI work at a big tech company on a remote team of about 10 people, and most of them have been here for 5+ years. I’m in the “newer” half of the team with 4 years here. My problem is, in group meetings, absolutely NO ONE talks. I mean zero small talk, they have trouble responding to simple yes or no questions. Everyone participates thoroughly when it’s a technical discussion, but it’s clear no one has any interest in speaking more than necessary. We used to have one super talkative guy on our team, and even then it was mostly silence to his chats about his weekend. Is there anything I can do to get these people to speak at least a little bit? It feels insane how little I know about these people after 4 years.\nP.S. even in one on one chats, almost all of them shut down small talk\nA coworker told me that I should be having quarterly one-on-one’s with my skip to make sure they’re aware of all the good stuff I’ve been up to and my goal of promotion. This sounds correct, but feels weird when I think about setting this up. I haven’t had much direct communication with my skip, just a few responses to his questions during design meetings, but nothing else really. How do I feel less weird about this?",

          "showNotes": "This week is a news roundup while cohost Jack is away for a hackathon in SF. \nFirst up, is how Chrome DevTools has added AI to its panels. Now users can ask Gemini to explain console errors, make CSS changes via in the elements tab, and explain traces collected in the performance panel.\nHTMX has also jumped from v2 to v4 (alpha), rebuilding the internals after 5 years of maintaining the project. Upgrades include: going from XMLHttpRequests to fetch, explicit attribute inheritance, and improved history caching.\nAngular’s meta-framework AnalogJS also just launched 2.0 which offers file-based routing, better Vite ecosystem support, and unified SSR, SSG, and islands-style hydration in one cohesive setup.\nRumor has it that next year Apple will be using Gemini to drive Siri, as it continues to try and get Apple Intelligence to work reliably.\nGitHub has officially disabled classic token creation for npm publishing in an effort to reign in the supply chain attacks we’ve reported on for the last few months. \nAnd last but not least, a company called NEO has a home assistant robot available for preorder now. The robot can clean, fold laundry, do dishes, and so on, but here’s the kicker: it’s a human piloting it remotely. Is this really the robot enhanced future we imagined?\nTimestamps:\n\n1:16 - Chrome DevTools gets a bunch of AI features\n8:39 - htmx v4 alpha\n14:25 - AnalogJS 2.0\n17:09 - Apple allegedly to use Gemini to drive Siri\n22:13 - GitHub disables classic token creation for npm\n27:38 - NEO home robot\n35:58 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - HTMX goes right from v2 to v4 (alpha)\nTJ - Chrome DevTools gets a bunch of AI features\n\nLightning News:\n\nAnalogJS 2.0\nApple allegedly to use Gemini to drive Siri\nGitHub’s disabled classic token creation for npm\nNEO home robot\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - The Survivalists novel\nTJ - Pokemon Legends Z–A game\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

This isn’t about adding AI features to your app — it’s about using LLMs and AI-powered tools as part of your day-to-day coding practice.\nWe talk through the tools we each rely on, how they’ve changed the way we write code, where they fall short, and where they can save hours of work. We also dig into the real differences between “AI-assisted coding” and “vibe coding,” the unexpected pitfalls of having AI write your tests, and the growing concerns juniors are facing in a job market that looks very different than it did just a few years ago. If you’re trying to figure out how to work with AI without losing your sanity (or your code quality), this one’s worth a listen.\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
