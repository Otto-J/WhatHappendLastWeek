          "showNotes": "This week, Robbie and Adam talk with Will Johnson—senior developer advocate at Auth0—about web dev, parenting, and internet culture. They debate whether CSS is a “real” programming language, riff on how modern frameworks can feel over-engineered, and dig into the security risks emerging around AI agents and MCP. Will shares what he’s been learning about MCP security, why he’s cautious with new tools, and how Auth0’s new AI agent offering helps manage identity, permissions, and token safety.\n\n\n\nPresented by CodeRabbit: https://coderabbit.ai\n\n\n\nIn this episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n(00:00) - Intro\n\n\n\n(01:49) - Meet Will Johnson\n\n\n\n(02:19) - Whiskey rating & review: Jameson Triple Triple\n\n\n\n(07:13) - Hot Take: Git rebase vs git merge\n\n\n\n(09:42) - Parenting talk: kids, wrestling, and learning consequences\n\n\n\n(11:57) - Hot Take: Is CSS a programming language?\n\n\n\n(14:37) - What Will’s working on at Auth0 (AI + MCP security)\n\n\n\n(16:57) - The most interesting MCP-related hacks and security risks\n\n\n\n(18:27) - Can “skills” become an attack vector too?\n\n\n\n(19:47) - Security vulnerabilities, Next.js updates, and patching fatigue\n\n\n\n(20:48) - How Will’s family got into K-Pop Demon Hunters\n\n\n\n(25:51) - The Moana live-action trailer “looks like useEffect” (and why)\n\n\n\n(27:17) - Is React essentially processed American food?\n\n\n\n(27:58) - Sugar-free Oreos: what are we even doing here?\n\n\n\n(29:18) - Have we overcomplicated frontend development?\n\n\n\n(31:32) - Why Rails is the best-engineered dev experience Will has used\n\n\n\n(32:25) - How Auth0 teams are structured\n\n\n\n(35:47) - Passkeys explained\n\n\n\n(41:43) - Plugs and how to connect with Will\n\n\n\n(43:12) - How AI agents fit into auth\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\n\nAuth0: https://auth0.com/\n\n\n\nJameson Triple Triple: https://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/en-us/our-whiskey/jameson-triple-triple/\n\n\n\nThree Sheets: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sheets\n\n\n\nJack Daniel's Reserve: https://www.jackdaniels.com/\n\n\n\nGoogle Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/\n\n\n\nShopify: https://www.shopify.com/\n\n\n\nCSS: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/\n\n\n\nJavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\n\n\n\nMCP: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n\n\n\nNext.js: https://nextjs.org/\n\n\n\nKPop Demon Hunters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters\n\n\n\nBritney Spears: https://britneyspears.com/\n\n\n\nNSYNC: https://nsync.com/\n\n\n\nB2K: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2K\n\n\n\nChris Brown: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown\n\n\n\nNetflix: https://netflix.com\n\n\n\nStanford University: https://www.stanford.edu/\n\n\n\nMoana: https://movies.disney.com/moana\n\n\n\nDak Prescott: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott\n\n\n\nReact: https://react.dev/\n\n\n\nOreo: https://www.oreo.com/\n\n\n\njQuery: https://jquery.com/\n\n\n\nKen Wheeler: https://x.com/ken_wheeler/\n\n\n\nES6: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp\n\n\n\nBlingBlingjs: https://github.com/argyleink/blingblingjs\n\n\n\nAstro: https://astro.build/\n\n\n\nRails: https://rubyonrails.org/\n\n\n\nLaravel: https://laravel.com/\n\n\n\nEgghead: https://egghead.io/\n\n\n\nGrok: https://grok.com/\n\n\n\n1Password: https://1password.com/\n\n\n\nGoogle Zanzibar: https://research.google/pubs/zanzibar-googles-consistent-global-authorization-system/\n\n\n\nAWS: https://aws.amazon.com/\n\n\n\nNetlify: https://www.netlify.com/\n\n\n\nPokemon Go: https://pokemongolive.com/\n\n\n\nConnect with Will\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://auth0.com/ai\n\n\n\nX / Twitter: https://x.com/willjohnsonio\n\n\n\nConnect with the hosts\n\n\n\n\n\nRobbie Wagner: https://x.com/RobbieTheWagner\n\n\n\nChuck Carpenter: https://x.com/CharlesWthe3rd\n\n\n\nAdam Argyle: https://x.com/argyleink\n\n\n\nSubscribe and stay in touch\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://whiskey.fm\n\n\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whiskey-web-and-whatnot/id1552776603\n\n\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/19jiuHAqzeKnkleQUpZxDf\n\n\n\nOvercast: https://overcast.fm/itunes1552776603\n\n\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@WhiskeyWebAndWhatnot\n\n\n\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot Merch\nEnjoying the podcast and want us to make more?

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHello gentlemen, long-time listener here, and I’d love your take on something that’s been keeping me up at night.\nThe high powered boss that I report to is someone I genuinely like and respect.This manager is smart, kind, honest, and overall great to work with. We have a solid relationship. I also come from big tech, so I sometimes feel I have better experience around managing projects and keeping teams organized. However she recently shared in confidence that there’s a chance of resigning in the next few months. and when I asked what keeps her up at night, the headache did not seem so big of a deal to me.\nBut ever since hearing this news, I’ve been catastrophizing the next few months. I’m not ready to job-hunt. At the same time, if this manager does leave, it could be a really good opportunity for me to step up.\nSo here’s what I’m struggling with:\n1.How do I position myself for a potential promotion without making it seem like I’m going behind my manager’s back or trying to undermine them?\n2.Should I quietly start looking for an job anyways, just in case?\n3.And how do I stay sane when this might all be for nothing and the manager might actually stay?\nWould really appreciate your wisdom on how to navigate this without losing more sleep.\nThanks for everything you do!\nI’ve worked as an engineering manager in a few big companies in Berlin, but after too much corporate politics bs, I flipped the fingers and quit. In the 2025 economy, that wasn’t the smartest move — finding a new job has been harder than ever.\nI’ve been focusing on smaller companies, ideally under 100 people. Ideally less politics, more autonomy. But now I’ve got an offer from Google in Bucharest — nearly double the compensation what I could get in Germany. The catch? I’d have to leave my strong circle of friends in Berlin and start over in a new city, new country.\nWhat would you do in my place? Brainstorm with me please 🥺",

          "showNotes": "We’re back with our first episode of 2026, and prominent software developer and YouTuber, Theo Browne, made waves recently when he announced he’d migrated his T3 Chat app from the Next.js framework to TanStack Start. It isn’t that Next.js is bad, but that the requirements of T3 Chat were better supported by TanStack Start’s architecture, and Theo breaks down his evaluation process to reach that decision.\nFor the 10th year in a row, the JavaScript Rising Stars report drops, and the most popular projects (by GitHub stars) for the year include n8n (a workflow automation platform), react-bits (gorgeous animated React components), shadcn/ui (more UI components), and Excalidraw (virtual whiteboard for sketching and diagramming).\nIn less stellar news, the creator of the wildly popular CSS library Tailwind announced he’s had to lay off 75% of his engineering team because AI has killed traffic to its website (and by association, Tailwind’s commercial products that drive revenue). It was hard enough before the rise of AI for OSS to get funding, and this is just another cautionary tale that we need to support the people building the tools and products so many of us use every day in our jobs.\nTimestamps:\n\n1:54 - Theo moves off Next.js and resulting buzz\n11:32 - A look at the 2025 JS rising stars\n23:25 - Is AI hurting Tailwind?\n31:03 - Lego smart bricks\n35:45 - What’s making us happy \n\nNews:\n\nPaige - Is AI killing OSS now? Tailwind thinks so\nJack - Theo moved off Next.js to TanStack Start and the internet is buzzing \nTJ - 2025 rising stars\n\nLightning News: \n\nLego smart bricks\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Flip-It!

We discuss how Tauri lets developers use frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular for the UI while handling heavy logic in Rust, resulting in smaller app binaries and better performance than Electron alternatives. The conversation covers Create Tauri App for faster onboarding, the new plugin system for controlling file system and OS access, and how Tauri improves app security by reducing attack surfaces. They also dive into mobile app development, differences between system WebViews, experiments with Chromium Embedded Framework, and why cross platform apps still need platform-specific thinking. Daniel also shares what’s coming next for Tauri, including flexibility in webviews, accessibility tooling, compliance requirements in Europe, and the roadmap toward Tauri 3.0.\nLinks\nTauri: https://v2.tauri.app\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/denjell\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us?
