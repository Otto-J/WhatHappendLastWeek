They dig into Robert’s open source journey, his insights on MCP and AI, and whether frameworks will remain relevant in an LLM-driven world. They also explore how AI changes the way new developers learn, the importance of systems thinking, and why open source sharpens both technical and soft skills.\nIn this episode:\n(00:00) - Intro\n(02:19) - Whiskey rating & review: Ohishi Whisky Ex Brandy Cask\n(14:09) - Hot take: GPT-5 vs Claude Sonnet 4\n(22:34) - Framework computers and modular desktops\n(29:37) - How open source shapes careers\n(36:25) - Will frameworks survive the rise of AI code?\n(46:53) - Kids and tech\n(47:51) - The great Buffalo Wild Wings detour\n(49:16) - How Robert turned fitness into a priority\nLinks\nOhishi Whisky Ex Brandy Cask: https://ohishiwhisky.com/\nEmber: https://emberjs.com/\nMCP: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n30 Rock: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock\nAlec Baldwin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin\nChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/\nClaude: https://claude.ai/\nOpus: https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus\nCursor: https://www.cursor.com/\nGitHub: https://github.com/\nNeovim: https://neovim.io/\nArch Linux: https://archlinux.org/\nApple: https://apple.com\nOllama: https://ollama.com/\nDHH: https://x.com/dhh/\nRuby on Rails: https://rubyonrails.org/\nMinecraft: https://www.minecraft.net/\nBuffalo Wild Wings: https://www.buffalowildwings.com/\nHot Ones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Ones\nMcDonald's: https://www.mcdonalds.com/\nMyFitnessPal: https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\nMacroFactor: https://macrofactorapp.com/\nConnect with Typecraft\nWebsite: https://typecraft.dev/\nX / Twitter: https://x.com/typecraft_dev\nConnect with Robert\nWebsite: https://www.rwjblue.com/\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/rwjblue.com\nConnect with Chuck and Robbie\nRobbie Wagner: https://x.com/RobbieTheWagner\nChuck Carpenter: https://x.com/CharlesWthe3rd\nSubscribe and stay in touch\nWebsite: https://whiskey.fm\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whiskey-web-and-whatnot/id1552776603\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/19jiuHAqzeKnkleQUpZxDf\nOvercast: https://overcast.fm/itunes1552776603\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@WhiskeyWebAndWhatnot\nWhiskey Web and Whatnot Merch\nEnjoying the podcast and want us to make more?

          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHi!\nI’m currently working for a big tech company and I’ve just accepted an internal transfer to another team. At the same time, an external company reached out, offering me a job for a role I’m interested in and twice my current compensation.\nI’m not sure what to do. The offer from the new company is very interesting and I wouldn’t think twice at accepting it if I still was in my old team. But now that I’ve accepted the internal transfer, I don’t know what’s best for my career: stay with my current company and lose out on a great offer, or go with the new company but likely burn bridges with my current manager, possibly closing off future opportunities to return to my current company (something that I’m open to in the future)?\nHow do I politely but firmly stop a project manager colleague, who has vast open plains in their calendar compared to my Tetris-stacked week as a senior software engineer, from parking themselves at my desk for 45-minute vent sessions about everything that’s frustrating them about our project? It’s never just the weather; it’s a full-blown TED Talk on their annoyances, which makes me feel defensive and frustrated in return. I’ve tried the headphones-on-and-look-intently-at-the-screen-approach, and sitting on the other side of the office, booking a smaller meeting room to hide, and carrying on working as they tell me about their troubles with both leadership and members of my team. Nothing seems to work. They find me every time. Is there a way to escape without faking my own death or staging an office fire drill? Thanks!",

          "showNotes": "The latest craze for MCP this week? Instead of multiple MCP servers with different tools, use an MCP server that accepts programming code as tool inputs - a single “ubertool” if you will. AI agents like Claude Code are pretty good at writing code, but letting the agent write and execute code to invoke API functions instead of using a defined MCP server doesn’t seem like the most efficient use of LLM tokens, but it's another approach to consider.\nIn infrastructure news, there’s a library called Alchemy that lets devs write their Infrastructure as Code in pure TypeScript. No Terraform files, no dependencies, just async functions, stored in plain JSON files, that runs anywhere JS can run. For web devs, the future of IaC has arrived.\nNext.js has made their last big release before v16 in the form of 15.5. Highlights of this minor release include: production turbopack builds, stable support for the Node.js runtime in middleware, fully typed routes, and deprecation warnings in preparation for Next.js 16.\nTimestamps:\n\n00:57 - Dangers of the “ubertool”\n09:54 - Alchemy Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n15:27 - Next.js 15.5\n24:57 - How CodeRabbit AI got hacked\n27:48 - <script type=”text/llms.txt”>\n32:37 - Claudia\n41:31 - hidden=until-found\n45:26 - What’s making us happy\n\nLinks:\n\nPaige - Alchemy Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\nJack - Dangers of the “ubertool”\nTJ - Next.js 15.5\nHow CodeRabbit AI got hacked\nClaudia\n<script type=\"text/llms.txt\">\nhidden=until-found\nPaige - The Art Thief book\nJack - Alien: Earth TV series\nTJ - Pips NYT game\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

They explore how Sentry has embraced a culture of experimentation with AI, from grassroots innovation in Slack channels to leadership setting the tone for rapid adoption. Cody shares insights into Sentry’s new AI monitoring tools, including MCP support and agent tracing, which give developers visibility into token usage, tool calls, and debugging flows. The discussion also touches on how AI is reshaping developer workflows, the balance between writing code and prompting, and why structured thinking is key to getting useful results.Keypoints from this episode:- Sentry fosters a playful, experimental environment where both grassroots initiatives and leadership drive AI adoption.- Sentry has rolled out AI monitoring with MCP support and agent tracing to give visibility into token usage, tool calls, and debugging.- AI is changing how developers approach coding, blending prompting with traditional programming.- Success with AI depends on framing problems clearly, not just relying on raw prompts.Cody De Arkland on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/codydearkland/ Rob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/Danny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/This Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabsThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMediaThis Dot Labs Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/This Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/This Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.socialSponsored by This Dot Labs: https://ai.thisdot.co",
