          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI have managed a product for some months now. My previous manager split their team in to mini-teams of 2-3 people. They gave me a small team and plenty of autonomy to own the product and go crazy on it. I had the time of my life as the team lead. I learned a ton and was really developing management skills.\nMy new manager is more hands-on. They want to do things my old manager left space for me to do, like project planning and quarterly planning. Now I feel micro managed when they get involved. I become territorial. It feels like he doesn’t recognize the independence of the mini team. I feel like I’m going backwards and and undoing all the management growth I’ve had, becoming just a software eng who should just keep their head down and work on a task.\nI don’t know what to do. How do I keep my independence and keep growing, but also get along with the new lead and learn from them in the process?\nI work as a senior engineer in a large team alongside a few other senior technical leaders. I’ve consistently received positive feedback from my manager about my impact — improving engineering quality, operational excellence, and team communication patterns.\nAt the same time, there have been challenges in collaboration and teamwork between other senior leaders and the teams they work closely with.\nMy manager has been highly supportive of the projects and changes I propose, and many improvements have been implemented based on my suggestions. However, during the recent promotion cycle, despite this positive feedback, I was not promoted, while another senior engineer — who is known to have collaboration challenges — was promoted instead.\nWhen I asked for feedback, I was told that while my contributions are appreciated and my time will come, they couldn’t explain the specific factors behind the promotion decision.\nI now feel a bit demotivated, as it seems engineering excellence and team impact may not be the primary factors considered for growth here.\nMy question is: How should I think about my next steps? Should I keep investing in this team or start considering other opportunities?",

Hannes breaks down Roo’s agentic coding model, explains how their “boomerang tasks” tackle LLM context limits, and shares lessons from working with contributors across experience levels.\n\n\nKeypoints from this episode:\n- RooCode's \"boomerang\" architecture breaks complex coding tasks into structured, recursive subtasks, helping AI agents stay focused while avoiding context bloat and hallucination chains.\n- Developers can build their own orchestrator and agent modes in Roo, tailoring persona and instructions to fit specific workflows—crucial for long-term productivity.\n- Unlike many tools, RooCode shows developers exactly how much each LLM call costs in real time, empowering teams to manage both quality and budget.\n- RooCode is deeply community-driven, with user-submitted PRs frequently reshaping priorities. The team emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility for contributors at all levels.\n\n\nFollow Hannes Rudolph on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannes-rudolph-64738b3b/\n\n\nSponsored by This Dot: thisdotlabs.com",

          "showNotes": "In this week’s episode, it’s just me — Charles Max Wood — and I’m joined by the incredibly sharp and open-source-loving Aral Roca, direct from Barcelona! Aral’s the creator of Brisa, a new full-stack web framework that flips the script on how we build modern web apps. If you thought the \"another day, another framework\" meme was played out... well, Brisa might just change your mind.\nKey Takeaways:\n-Brisa’s Big Idea: It's designed to let you build web apps with minimal or zero JavaScript on the client side. Think HTML streaming, server actions, and components that render server-side first, but can gradually hydrate on the client.\n-Server-first FTW: Aral walks us through how Brisa handles server actions — even capturing click and scroll events on the server — using ideas inspired by HTMX, LiveView, and server components from frameworks like Next.js.\n-Tiny and Mighty: The whole framework is incredibly lightweight. Web components come in at just ~3 KB, and the built-in i18n system is under 1 KB!\n-From Idea to Reality: Aral started Brisa to scratch his own itch — building side projects and blogs without bloated front-end code. But now, others are using it too (yes, even in production!), including one travel agency that's gone all-in.\n-Multi-platform Future: Brisa has adapters in the works for Vercel, Node, and Deno — plus integration with Tauri for building native Android, iOS, and desktop apps from the same codebase.\n-What's Coming: Roadmap goals include improved hot reloads, more adapters, transitions, lazy-loaded components, and a better playground for developers to tinker with.\nOh, and yes — Aral does parkour. For real.\nThis episode is packed with deep technical insight and exciting potential for a new way to build web apps — especially for devs who love fast performance, server-rendering, and clean architecture.\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
