          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nI handed in my resignation this past Monday. During the conversation, my manager confided in me that this coming Wednesday, 25% of the workforce is being laid off.\nFor context, this is the second round of layoffs. The first round happened a year ago and was a disaster. It was announced via an internal video the night before, but the CEO forgot to mention that the affected employees had already been notified privately. This caused mass panic; thinking they were next, many experienced engineers immediately brushed up their resumes and jumped ship voluntarily. Even my skip-level manager was in the dark. Shortly after that chaos, we were acquired by an American Private Equity firm.\nMorale has been at an all-time low ever since, and the writing has been on the wall all year.\nNow I am in the awkward position of serving my three-month notice period while walking through the ruins of my company. I am the “lucky one” who quit voluntarily two days before the hammer dropped to join a different company for a massive raise and promotion, while my colleagues are about to lose their jobs.\nHow do I navigate the next 90 days? How do I interact with the survivors who are likely furious and overworked, knowing I’m already checking out?\nSincerely,\nRearranging Deckchairs on the Titanic\nHello!\nI have a bad manager, like really bad. She gets the whole team together to say “so and so is getting laid off tomorrow, or in a month, don’t say anything”.\nShe openly shares employee compensation in 1-1’s, gossips about her boss and team members and takes feedback as personal attacks.\nWould you believe me if I said that no one trusts her?\nWhat should I do? I want to contact HR but I have never talked to HR before in my career. I know I can’t tell her because engineers who have offered feedback on team dynamics, or general professionalism, get yelled in 1-1’s. Is this something worth taking to HR or do I just live with it until… I get a new job? If I do say something what do I say? Do I bring up the distrust she has created amongst the team or do I keep it to the poor judgement and unprofessionalism?\nDo you want to write the letter for me? Yes!? Thanks!",

          "showNotes": "Hot on the heels of the first critical vulnerability discovered in React applications using RSCs last week, two more vulnerabilities have surfaced, which is not uncommon. Even if you already updated for the critical vulnerability, you will need to update again.\nIn lighter news, Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation, just one year after introducing it to the world. MCP’s rise has been meteoric: 10,000 active public MCP servers, adoption by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, VS Code, and more, and now stewardship by the AAIF, which is under the Linux Foundation.\nWith all the great things coming to CSS lately, the Chrome Dev team created a great CSS Wrapped write up highlighting the big features for 2025. Of the 22 new features added, invoker commands, popover enhancements, and customizable select dropdowns are some of the most exciting additions.\nTimestamps:\n\n2:29 - More vulnerabilities in RSCs\n6:36 - Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation\n16:04 - CSS 2025 wrap up\n25:05 - Disney to allow characters on Sora\n29:42 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - Anthropic donates MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation\nJack - More vulnerabilities in RSCs discovered\nTJ - CSS Wrapped 2025\n\nLightning News: \n\nDisney will allow characters on Sora AI video generator\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Twinkly Christmas Lights\nJack - 3D printed underwear for the multiboard desk organization\nTJ - Mammoth\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

Tanner breaks down TanStack Start and its client-first approach to SSR, routing, and data loading, and shares his perspective on React Server Components, modern authentication tradeoffs, and composable tooling. The episode wraps with a look at TanStack’s roadmap and what it takes to sustainably maintain open source at scale.\nWe want to hear from you!\nHow did you find us? Did you see us on Twitter?
