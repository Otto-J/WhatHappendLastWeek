          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHey Dave and Jamison,\nBig fan of the show — listening from Portugal! (Proof that even across the Atlantic, software politics are universal.)\nI’m a tech lead, and lately I’ve noticed a culture where people seem to care way more about how things look than what actually gets done. It’s like the appearance of productivity matters more than real impact. Honestly, it drives me nuts!!\nI know politics are part of any organization, and way more in a leadership role, but this feels excessive. As someone who values substance and solid engineering, how do I deal with or influence this kind of culture without losing my sanity (or turning into one of those “optics-first” people myself)?\nThanks for all the insights and laughs. Kudos from Portugal!\nListener Charlie says,\nI’m fresh out of college at my first software engineering job. Several months ago I was appointed the accessibility champion for my team. I proposed a few items in the quarterly planning session, but I think it wasn’t enough. My project manager called out our whole team, but I think it was mostly aimed at me.\nI’ve been struggling with creating Jira cards, shaping with the team, writing a11y guidelines, etc. It’s tedious and I’m not really familiar with this kind of work. How can I get better at the “other stuff” besides just writing code?\nP.S. I volunteered for this responsibility 😩",

          "showNotes": "Another week, another new AI IDE. This week, Google released the Antigravity IDE (yet another VS Code fork) which offers unique twists like “cross-surface” agents, user feedback to agent-generated artifacts, and a view of all agents across any workspace.\nThe team behind the Unistyles cross-platform library just debuted Uniwind for all the React Native devs who want to use Tailwind styling in their native apps. Uniwind brings Tailwind-style className support to RN at build time, and has a custom, high-performance CSS parser to handle both Tailwind 4 and plain CSS files. \nPrisma 7.0 is out, and so is Rust from its codebase. The team completely rebuilt it in TypeScript to cut down on its bundle size and the communication layer between Rust and the JS runtime that was actually slower than just JavaScript through and through.\nIn Lightning News, even if you don’t develop in Angular, the Angular v21 dev release video is worth a watch, Cloudflare had a big Internet outage this week, Firefox has teased AI in its browser “the Firefox way”, and the State of React Survey 2025 is open now (please vote for Front-end Fire in the Podcasts section!).\nTimestamps:\n\n1:27 - Prisma 7.0\n9:35 - Uniwind\n12:18 - Antigravity\n27:32 - Angular v21 release video\n29:20 - Cloudflare outage\n37:11 - Firefox gets an AI window\n38:47 - State of React survey open\n40:36 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - Uniwind\nJack - Prisma 7.0\nTJ - Antigravity\n\nLightning News:\n\nFirefox gets an AI window\nCloudflare had a big outage\nThe State of React Survey 2025 is now open\nAngular v21 Dev Release video\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - Upcoming holidays and seeing family\nJack - StroboClip HD for the guitar\nTJ - Dungeon Crawler Carl book\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.
