      <title>MCP Security, Framework Fatigue, and AI Agents with Will Johnson (Presented by CodeRabbit)</title>
      <link>https://whiskey.fm</link>
      <description>This week, Robbie and Adam talk with Will Johnson—senior developer advocate at Auth0—about web dev, parenting, and internet culture. They debate whether CSS is a “real” programming language, riff on how modern frameworks can feel over-engineered, and dig into the security risks emerging around AI agents and MCP. Will shares what he’s been learning about MCP security, why he’s cautious with new tools, and how Auth0’s new AI agent offering helps manage identity, permissions, and token safety.



Presented by CodeRabbit: https://coderabbit.ai

      <title>Episode 495: What to do when my boss quits and moving to Romania?</title>
      <link>https://softskills.audio/2026/01/12/episode-495-what-to-do-when-my-boss-quits-and-moving-to-romania/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:
Hello gentlemen, long-time listener here, and I’d love your take on something that’s been keeping me up at night.
The high powered boss that I report to is someone I genuinely like and respect.This manager is smart, kind, honest, and overall great to work with. We have a solid relationship. I also come from big tech, so I sometimes feel I have better experience around managing projects and keeping teams organized. However she recently shared in confidence that there’s a chance of resigning in the next few months. and when I asked what keeps her up at night, the headache did not seem so big of a deal to me.
But ever since hearing this news, I’ve been catastrophizing the next few months. I’m not ready to job-hunt. At the same time, if this manager does leave, it could be a really good opportunity for me to step up.
So here’s what I’m struggling with:
1.How do I position myself for a potential promotion without making it seem like I’m going behind my manager’s back or trying to undermine them?
2.Should I quietly start looking for an job anyways, just in case?
3.And how do I stay sane when this might all be for nothing and the manager might actually stay?
Would really appreciate your wisdom on how to navigate this without losing more sleep.
Thanks for everything you do!
I’ve worked as an engineering manager in a few big companies in Berlin, but after too much corporate politics bs, I flipped the fingers and quit. In the 2025 economy, that wasn’t the smartest move — finding a new job has been harder than ever.
I’ve been focusing on smaller companies, ideally under 100 people. Ideally less politics, more autonomy. But now I’ve got an offer from Google in Bucharest — nearly double the compensation what I could get in Germany. The catch? I’d have to leave my strong circle of friends in Berlin and start over in a new city, new country.
What would you do in my place? Brainstorm with me please 🥺</description>

      <title>127: Are People Leaving Next.js for TanStack Start?</title>
      <link>https://www.buzzsprout.com/2226499</link>
      <description>We’re back with our first episode of 2026, and prominent software developer and YouTuber, Theo Browne, made waves recently when he announced he’d migrated his T3 Chat app from the Next.js framework to TanStack Start. It isn’t that Next.js is bad, but that the requirements of T3 Chat were better supported by TanStack Start’s architecture, and Theo breaks down his evaluation process to reach that decision.
For the 10th year in a row, the JavaScript Rising Stars report drops, and the most popular projects (by GitHub stars) for the year include n8n (a workflow automation platform), react-bits (gorgeous animated React components), shadcn/ui (more UI components), and Excalidraw (virtual whiteboard for sketching and diagramming).
In less stellar news, the creator of the wildly popular CSS library Tailwind announced he’s had to lay off 75% of his engineering team because AI has killed traffic to its website (and by association, Tailwind’s commercial products that drive revenue). It was hard enough before the rise of AI for OSS to get funding, and this is just another cautionary tale that we need to support the people building the tools and products so many of us use every day in our jobs.
Timestamps:

1:54 - Theo moves off Next.js and resulting buzz
11:32 - A look at the 2025 JS rising stars
23:25 - Is AI hurting Tailwind?
31:03 - Lego smart bricks
35:45 - What’s making us happy 

News:

Paige - Is AI killing OSS now? Tailwind thinks so
Jack - Theo moved off Next.js to TanStack Start and the internet is buzzing 
TJ - 2025 rising stars

Lightning News: 

Lego smart bricks

What Makes Us Happy this Week:

Paige - Flip-It! Bottle emptying caps
Jack - Miami Hurricanes football team 
TJ - New Pokemon GO features

      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/devtoolsfm/episodes/Peter-van-Hardenberg---Ink-and-Switch--Automerge-e3dh43a</link>
      <description>This week we're joined by Peter van Hardenberg (PVH), director of the Ink and Switch research lab and co-author of the seminal Local First Software paper.Peter shares the origin story of local-first software, from his realization on a San Francisco train to his work at Heroku and beyond.We dive deep into Automerge, Ink and Switch's local-first sync engine built on CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), exploring how it enables real-time collaboration while keeping data on your computer.We discuss the technical challenges of building distributed systems, the philosophy behind local-first software, and how projects like Key Hive are pushing the boundaries of decentralized data access.Peter also shares his vision for the future of computing, where software ownership and interoperability become fundamental principles rather than afterthoughts.

      <description>Stack Overflow fue durante años el lugar donde todos los programadores aprendimos a resolver problemas reales. Hoy, su caída refleja un cambio profundo en cómo buscamos respuestas, aprendemos y escribimos código con la llegada de la IA. En este episodio hablamos de qué está pasando, por qué importa y qué riesgos y oportunidades trae este cambio para los desarrolladores.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Stack Overflow fue durante años el lugar donde todos los programadores aprendimos a resolver problemas reales. Hoy, su caída refleja un cambio profundo en cómo buscamos respuestas, aprendemos y escribimos código con la llegada de la IA. En este episodio hablamos de qué está pasando, por qué importa y qué riesgos y oportunidades trae este cambio para los desarrolladores.</itunes:summary>

      <title>What's new with Tauri | Daniel Thompson-Yvetot</title>
      <link>http://podrocket.logrocket.com/whats-new-with-tauri-with-daniel-thompson-yvetot</link>
      <description>In this episode of PodRocket, Daniel Thompson--Yvetot joins us to break down what’s new in Tauri 2.0 and how developers are using the Tauri framework to build desktop and mobile apps with Rust and JavaScript. We discuss how Tauri lets developers use frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular for the UI while handling heavy logic in Rust, resulting in smaller app binaries and better performance than Electron alternatives. The conversation covers Create Tauri App for faster onboarding, the new plugin system for controlling file system and OS access, and how Tauri improves app security by reducing attack surfaces. They also dive into mobile app development, differences between system WebViews, experiments with Chromium Embedded Framework, and why cross platform apps still need platform-specific thinking. Daniel also shares what’s coming next for Tauri, including flexibility in webviews, accessibility tooling, compliance requirements in Europe, and the roadmap toward Tauri 3.0.
