          "showNotes": "In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:\nHi! Love your show and how casually you talk and make fun of everything! I started my career as a freelancer and then joined a mid-size software development company to learn how the sausage is really made, salary wasn’t that important back then. A few kids and a lot more expensive lifestyle later the compensation has become more motivating, but I’m not sure how to sell myself to my manager if I don’t feel like I deserve a high salary myself. (The manager decides the salaries for all our team members.) For years I’ve been focusing on my family and other life stuff, so I’ve spent a looot of working hours not working and basically doing the minimum progress acceptable. Slow progress has come up once with my manager, from which I wiggled out of with various excuses. I’ve realised that this way of working isn’t really fair for the company and my teammates and I’ve started to take this job and my career seriously in the last few months. The company and everyone working there are super supportive and it’s been a terrific experience for all of those years. I’ve gotten a raise multiple times with always me initiating that conversation. There aren’t any clear metrics to improve that directly ties to the salary: I’ve asked my manager about it and the answer was vague like “we have this local salary survey that we take as the base and work from there”. So long story short: how to ask for a raise while not feeling like a criminal since I feel like I haven’t earned the salary I had thus far?\nI’m a team lead who’s growing increasingly frustrated with my project manager. Every planning conversation ends up in my private DMs, no matter how many times I’ve asked him to move these discussions to the team chat.\nWhen he messages me one-on-one, my team loses visibility into decisions, questions don’t get addressed openly, and important context just evaporates. It’s not only slowing us down, it also makes me feel like the burden of relaying everything falls squarely on me.\nI’ve tried gently redirecting him back to the shared space, but he keeps defaulting to my DMs. How can I get him to respect the boundaries of team communication without damaging our working relationship?\nSincerely,\nLost in the PM’s DMs",

          "showNotes": "Another week, another new AI-browser. This time it’s OpenAI’s turn to introduce ChatGPT Atlas. As with the other AI browsers, Atlas knows the context of open tabs, has an agent that can do things for you, and (maybe its defining feature) it has \"memory\" built in so conversations can draw on past chats and details when needed.\nThe team behind Vite reveals their path to revenue with command line devtool Vite+. Devs will soon be able to test, lint, format, bundle, and even view their apps’ stats with Vite+, with the performance we expect from a compiler toolchain built completely in Rust. Plus, it’s free for individual users and OSS projects, and has annual licensing prices for startups and enterprises.\nVercel held not one but two conferences this week: Next.js Conf and then Ship AI. Next.js 16 was unveiled with improvements to Turbopack, a Next.js DevTools MCP, and updates to Cache Components. And Ship AI covered updates to the AI SDK, Vercel’s AI Gateway and Agents, and more. \nChapter Markers:\n\n02:05 - ChatGPT Atlas\n12:38 - Vite+\n20:21 - Next.js conf and Ship AI\n28:07 - Claude Code on the web\n33:02 - The Louvre was robbed\n38:02 - What’s making us happy\n\nNews:\n\nPaige - Vite+\nJack - Next.js Conf and Ship AI conf updates\nTJ - ChatGPT Atlas\n\nLightning News:\n\nClaude Code on the web\nThe Louvre was robbed\n\nWhat Makes Us Happy this Week:\n\nPaige - The Diplomat TV series\nJack - Timers to limit doom scrolling\nTJ - Claude Code\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, the Blue Collar Coder channel on YouTube.

From phishing campaigns targeting top NPM maintainers to the now-infamous Chalk library compromise, we unpack the latest wave of JavaScript package attacks and what developers can learn from them.\nFeross explains how some hackers are even using AI tools like Claude and Gemini as part of their payloads—and how defenders like Socket are fighting back with AI-powered analysis of their own. We also dive into GitHub Actions vulnerabilities, the role of two-factor authentication, and the growing need for “phishing-resistant 2FA.” Whether you’re an open source maintainer or just someone who runs npm install a little too often, this episode will open your eyes to how much happens behind the scenes to keep your code safe.\n🔗 Links & Resources\nSocket.dev – Protect your open source dependencies\nFeross Aboukhadijeh on X (Twitter)\nGitHub Actions Security Best Practices\nTruffleHog Blog – On secrets exposure in Git repos\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/javascript-jabber--6102064/support.",
