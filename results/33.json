          "itemTitle": "The simplicity of deploying an MCP server on Vercel",
          "media": null,
          "showNotes": "The current Model Context Protocol (MCP) spec is shifting developers toward lightweight, stateless servers that serve as tool providers for LLM agents. These MCP servers communicate over HTTP, with OAuth handled clientside. Vercel’s infrastructure makes it easy to iterate quickly and ship agentic AI tools without overhead.\nExample of Lightweight MCP Server Design\nAt This Dot Labs, we built an  MCP server that leverages the DocuSign Navigator API. The tools, like get_agreements, make a request to the DocuSign API to fetch data and then respond in an LLM-friendly way.\n   // Get agreements tool that requires authentication\n   server.tool(\n     'get_agreements',\n     'Retrieve DocuSign Navigator agreements. Returns a list of all agreements available in the system with metadata like title, type, status, and parties.',\n     {}, // No input parameters needed\n     getAgreementsHandler\n   );\n\n   // Get agreement by ID tool that requires authentication\n   server.tool(\n     'get_agreement_by_id',\n     'Retrieve detailed information about a specific DocuSign Navigator agreement by its ID. Returns comprehensive details including title, type, status, summary, parties, provisions, metadata, and custom attributes. REQUIRED: agreementId parameter must be provided.',\n     { agreementId: z.string().min(1, 'Agreement ID is required') },\n     getAgreementByIdHandler\n   );\n\nBefore the MCP can request anything, it needs to guide the client on how to kick off OAuth. This involves providing some MCP spec metadata API endpoints that include necessary information about where to obtain authorization tokens and what resources it can access. By understanding these details, the client can seamlessly initiate the OAuth process, ensuring secure and efficient data access.\nThe Oauth flow begins when the user's LLM client makes a request without a valid auth token. In this case they’ll get a 401 response from our server with a WWW-Authenticate header, and then the client will leverage the metadata we exposed to discover the authorization server. Next, the OAuth flow kicks off directly with Docusign as directed by the metadata. Once the client has the token, it passes it in the Authorization header for tool requests to the API. \nAPI Routes\n├── Health & Monitoring\n│   └── GET /health\n│\n├── OAuth 2.0 Discovery (.well-known)\n│   ├── GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n│   └── GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n│\n├── OAuth 2.0 Flow\n│   ├── GET/POST /register\n│   ├── GET /authorize\n│   ├── POST /token\n│   └── GET /auth/callback\n│\n└── MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n    └── POST /mcp Main endpoint\n\nThis minimal set of API routes enables me to fetch Docusign Navigator data using natural language in my agent chat interface.\nDeployment Options\nI deployed this MCP server two different ways: as a Fastify backend and then by Vercel functions. Seeing how simple my Fastify MCP server was, and not really having a plan for deployment yet, I was eager to rewrite it for Vercel.\nThe case for Vercel:\nMy own familiarity with Next.js API deployment\nFit for architecture\nThe extremely simple deployment process\nDeploy previews (the eternal Vercel customer conversion feature, IMO)\nPreviews of unfamiliar territory\nDid you know that the MCP spec doesn’t “just work” for use as ChatGPT tooling? Neither did I, and I had to experiment to prove out requirements that I was unfamiliar with. Part of moving fast for me was just deploying Vercel previews right out of the CLI so I could test my API as a Connector in ChatGPT. This was a great workflow for me, and invaluable for the team in code review.\nStuff I’m Not Worried About\nVercel’s mcp-handler package made setup effortless by abstracting away some of the complexity of implementing the MCP server. It gives you a drop-in way to define tools, setup https-streaming, and handle Oauth. By building on Vercel’s ecosystem, I can focus entirely on shipping my product without worrying about deployment, scaling, or server management. Everything just works.\nimport { createMcpHandler, withMcpAuth } from 'mcp-handler';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nimport {\n authStatusHandler,\n getAgreementsHandler,\n getAgreementByIdHandler,\n searchHandler,\n fetchHandler,\n} from '../lib/mcp/handlers/index.js';\nimport { createTokenVerifier } from '../lib/mcp/auth.js';\n\n// Create the base MCP handler with both authenticated and non-authenticated tools\nconst handler = createMcpHandler(\n server => {\n\n   // Get agreements tool that requires authentication\n   server.tool(\n     'get_agreements',\n     'Retrieve DocuSign Navigator agreements. Returns a list of all agreements available in the system with metadata like title, type, status, and parties.',\n     {}, // No input parameters needed\n     getAgreementsHandler\n   );\n);\n\n// Wrap the handler with authentication - all tools require valid authentication\nconst authHandler = withMcpAuth(handler, createTokenVerifier(), {\n required: true, // All tools require authentication - this triggers 401 responses\n requiredScopes: ['signature'], // Require at least the signature scope\n resourceMetadataPath: '/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource', // Custom metadata path\n});\n\nexport { authHandler as GET, authHandler as POST };\n\nA Brief Case for MCP on Next.js\nBuilding an API without Next.js on Vercel is straightforward. Though, I’d be happy deploying this as a Next.js app, with the frontend features serving as the documentation, or the tools being a part of your website's agentic capabilities. Overall, this lowers the barrier to building any MCP you want for yourself, and I think that’s cool.\nConclusion\nI'll avoid quoting Vercel documentation in this post. AI tooling is a critical component of this natural language UI, and we just want to ship. I declare Vercel is excellent for stateless MCP servers served over http.",

I sit in between lawyers and developers. I advise on technology that can be applied to legal processes and I support our teams in using a range of platforms and AI tools to be more efficient across their work.\nI have ADHD (late diagnosis at 22) and often have trouble with executive function, remembering details, progressing large projects with no deadlines, and remembering verbal instructions.\nHave either of you ever had a neurodivergent person on your team? If so, how did you support them? What environment helped them to work best? Also, what frustrations did you have and how could they have mitigated them?\nAny help would be appreciated to help me avoid driving my manager insane (I live in constant fear that one day she will snap and I’ll be fired even multiple years in). 😂\nHi Dave and Jamison,\nyou’ve made my runs very enjoyable over the last years, thank you so much for that - even though I doubt that laughing out all the time is great for my performance.\nI’ve been in web development for 7 years now and a Lead Fullstack Engineer at a consulting firm. Being a “lead” currently only means that my team mates seek my opinion and guidance on topics, without me having any increased responsibility. In September, I’ll move countries (Europe to Australia) and will be on parental leave until mid ‘26 when I’ll have to look for a new job down under. I feel quite stressed by recent developments (AI), already have the feeling of not being able to keep up with all the new things (ask my 300 open tabs of articles I want to read), and fear that I could loose touch in my time off. How can I deal with this FOMO? And which topics would you look into in the upcoming months if you were in my place?\nShow Notes\nhttps://blog.jsbarretto.com/post/software-is-joy\nhttps://medium.com/@djsmith42/the-3-highest-roi-technical-skills-for-software-developers-21b412d79aff",

Philipp explains how Elastic approaches information retrieval beyond just vector search, using tools like LLMs for smarter querying, log parsing, and context-aware data access.\nThey also discuss how Elastic balances innovation with stability through regular releases and a focus on long-term reliability. For teams building with AI, Elastic offers a way to handle search, monitoring, and logging in one platform, making it easier to ship faster without adding complexity.\nKey points from this episode:\t\n\n Elasticsearch has expanded beyond search to support observability and security by treating all of them as information retrieval problems.\n\n\nElastic integrates with AI tools like LLMs to improve search relevance, automate log parsing, and enable features like query rewriting and retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n\nVector search is just one feature in a larger toolkit for finding relevant data, and Elastic supports hybrid and traditional search approaches.\n\n\nElastic maintains a steady release cadence with a focus on stability, making it a reliable choice for both fast-moving AI projects and long-term production systems.\n\n\n\nPhilipp Krenn on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippkrenn/\nRob Ocel on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robocel/\nDanny Thompson on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/\nThis Dot Labs Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotLabs\nThis Dot Media Twitter: https://x.com/ThisDotMediaThis Dot Labs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisdotlabs/\nThis Dot Labs Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thisdot/\nThis Dot Labs Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/thisdotlabs.bsky.social\nSponsored by This Dot Labs: ai.thisdot.co",
